# ML Pipeline: DiscoverTec Methodology

This document defines DiscoverTec’s end-to-end ML pipeline and value delivery framework. We are executing a Wave A (0–3 mo) Refill Prediction MVP: a lean, stream-aligned pod will build data ingestion, first-generation refill features, baseline models, a serverless production deployment, and telemetry that directly feeds refill, adherence, and cost KPIs. Subsequent waves (B→D) progressively automate, govern, and scale the platform, mirroring leading MLOps maturity guidance (Google CI/CD/CT, Microsoft MLOps Maturity & Responsible AI) and FinOps AI cost forecasting practices that tie cloud spend to value streams.

## Business Alignment

Refill reminder and digital adherence interventions across healthcare populations have shown measurable improvements in on-time medication use, therapy persistence, and downstream utilization, drivers that map to revenue retention and refill volume uplift assumptions. Financial incentive + refill reminder programs have improved adherence in claims data, and SMS/mobile reminder meta-analyses show statistically significant effects. Standing up even a minimally automated predictive refill capability yields early data to quantify upside and de-risk larger platform investment.

## Roles

Our Wave A pod is stream-aligned to a single flow of value: *predict, surface, and act on next refill opportunities for active prescriptions*. Each role includes “Platform & Tools” guidance for AWS, Azure, and OSS portability; all work lands in a single backlog owned by the Lead Engineer (LE), eliminating silo handoffs that slow ML productionization, an anti-pattern widely cited in DevOps/MLOps integration analyses. ([*TechRadar*](https://www.techradar.com/pro/breaking-silos-unifying-devops-and-mlops-into-a-unified-software-supply-chain?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Microsoft Learn*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

| Role                      | Core Focus                          | Key Outputs (Wave A)                                     |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Engineer (DE)        | Secure ingest, schema, lineage      | Source connectors; raw→curated jobs; data quality checks |
| Feature Engineer (FE)     | Signal discovery, feature pipelines | Versioned feature sets; feature docs; drift checks       |
| Training Engineer (TE)    | Model training & HPO                | Train pipelines; experiment logs; model artifacts        |
| DevSecOps Engineer (DO)   | CI/CD, infra, security, cost        | Deploy manifests; cost tags; monitoring plumbing         |
| Evaluation Engineer (EvE) | Metrics, drift, business impact     | Eval datasets; dashboards; improvement recs              |
| Lead (LE)                 | Backlog, KPIs, FinOps, stakeholder  | KPI tree; sprint plans; cost dashboard; decision gates   |

Value stream-aligned teams that own data→model→deploy flow show faster iteration and lower coordination load vs functionally sliced orgs; both Google and Microsoft maturity models advocate incremental capability growth within such pods. ([*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Microsoft Learn*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*TechRadar*](https://www.techradar.com/pro/breaking-silos-unifying-devops-and-mlops-into-a-unified-software-supply-chain?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## Architecture

### Pipeline

```
Data Sources → Extraction → Preparation → Exploration → Feature Engineering
     ↓                                                            ↓
Monitoring ← Deployment ← Validation ← Training ← Model Architecture
     ↓                                      ↑                     ↑
Improvement → Evaluation → Performance Analysis → Retraining Loop
```

This directional pipeline reflects continuous integration (CI), continuous delivery (CD), and continuous training (CT), the three automation pillars highlighted in Google’s MLOps framework and echoed in AWS SageMaker MLOps patterns. ([*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Amazon Web Services, Inc.*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-an-end-to-end-mlops-pipeline-using-amazon-sagemaker-pipelines-github-and-github-actions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### Stage Detail

Each stage below has:

-   Objective
-   Team Activities (Wave A scope)
-   Client Collaboration
-   Deliverables

#### Stage 1: Data Discovery & Assessment (Week 1-2)

Objective: Identify and prioritize data needed to predict refill timing; surface quality, compliance, and integration risks early.

Team Activities:

-   Profile top sources: prescription orders, fulfillment/shipments, vet reauth status, inventory file.
-   Basic completeness, date consistency, and join keys.
-   Identify PHI/PII & pet/owner linkage requirements.
-   Document data freshness cadence.

Client Collaboration:

-   Stakeholder interviews (pharmacy ops, IT, vet partner integration).
-   Secure access (VPN / IAM roles / bucket policies).
-   Align business rules: days’ supply, auto-ship logic, refill restrictions.
-   Define Wave A success metrics (adherence, response to outreach).

Deliverables:

-   Data Assessment Report
-   Compliance & Security Matrix
-   Source → Target Mapping Sheet
-   Initial Risk Register

Business Impact Tie: Early detection of data coverage gaps prevents false lift estimates in adherence/churn modeling and reduces rework, core MLOps best practice. ([*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Amazon Web Services, Inc.*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-an-end-to-end-mlops-pipeline-using-amazon-sagemaker-pipelines-github-and-github-actions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

#### Stage 2: Data Extraction & Ingestion (Week 2-4)

Objective: Stand up reliable pipelines to land data in an analyzable, auditable store.

Team Activities (Wave A):

-   Build 2–3 ingestion jobs (batch) to S3 “raw” zone.
-   Normalize schema, enforce minimal type checks.
-   Add hash or watermark for incremental loads.
-   Lightweight data quality alerts (row count delta, null spikes).

Client Collaboration:

-   API keys / DB read replicas with IT.
-   Joint sample validation on first 3 loads.
-   Agree on freshness SLA (daily recommended).
-   Schema change notification channel.

Deliverables:

-   Ingestion jobs (IaC / repo)
-   Validated raw zone data
-   Data quality alert rules
-   SLA doc

Business Impact Tie: Timely, accurate ingestion drives *when* outreach can occur; stale data reduces adherence lift. Google CI/CD/CT stresses data pipeline reliability; FinOps notes data duplication/transfer inflation as hidden cost drivers. ([*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*FinOps Foundation*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Growth: Add CDC, streaming (Kinesis/Kafka), automated schema drift gating. AWS SageMaker pipeline blog shows data prep step automation; TechRadar notes integration gaps cause ML delays. ([*Amazon Web Services, Inc.*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-an-end-to-end-mlops-pipeline-using-amazon-sagemaker-pipelines-github-and-github-actions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*TechRadar*](https://www.techradar.com/pro/breaking-silos-unifying-devops-and-mlops-into-a-unified-software-supply-chain?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

#### Stage 3: Data Preparation & Cleaning (Week 3-5)

Objective: Produce curated, analysis-ready tables for feature engineering with auditable transforms.

Team Activities (Wave A):

-   Standardize units (days’ supply, weight ranges by species).
-   Handle missing ship dates, duplicates, and canceled fills.
-   Join Rx → shipments → inventory snapshot.
-   Tag training splits (train/val/test by time).

Client Collaboration:

-   Domain workshops to validate transformation rules.
-   Rule sign-off (e.g., handle partial fill logic).
-   Review of data quality metrics.

Deliverables:

-   Curated tables (parquet/Delta)
-   Data dictionary & transformation log
-   Data quality scorecard

Business Impact Tie: Garbage-in → inaccurate refill predictions → wasted outreach cost & overstated ROI; strong data quality disciplines reduce ML technical debt (Google, Microsoft). ([*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Microsoft Learn*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Growth: Reusable transform library; automated data quality CI gating; policy-driven data governance. Microsoft MLOps maturity and Google whitepaper both flag data validation as a maturity milestone. ([*Microsoft Learn*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

#### Stage 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (Week 4-6)

Objective: Discover patterns that drive refill timing signal and segment customer behavior.

Team Activities (Wave A):

-   Distribution of days’ supply vs observed refill intervals.
-   Late vs on-time refill cohort differences (species, condition).
-   Seasonal consumption (flea/heartworm).
-   Correlation of vet reauth delays to refill lapses.

Client Collaboration:

-   Weekly insight reviews w/ ops + merchandising.
-   Validate flagged anomalies (bulk orders, clinical switches).
-   Prioritize features with business value.

Deliverables:

-   EDA report + dashboard (notebook + PDF)
-   Feature candidate ranking
-   Modeling strategy brief

Business Impact Tie: Focuses later modeling on high-yield signals; reduces wasted training cycles (cloud cost) and accelerates time-to-value. FinOps AI cost work emphasizes pruning low-value experimentation. ([*FinOps Foundation*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Growth: Scheduled automated EDA trend jobs; anomaly alerts; cross-cohort benchmarking. Google CI/CD/CT recommends automating recurring analysis as maturity grows. ([*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

#### Stage 5: Feature Engineering (Week 5-8)

Objective: Create reproducible, versioned feature sets that capture refill risk signals.

Wave A Core Features (examples):

-   Calculated days remaining (based on quantity, SIG, days’ supply).
-   Historical refill interval variance per customer/med.
-   Late shipment delta (days between expected vs actual ship).
-   Seasonal medication flag (parasite prevention months).
-   Vet reauth lead time & expiration countdown.

Client Collaboration: 2-day domain feature workshop; business rule encoding; feature interpretability review; PII/PHI checks.

Deliverables:

-   Feature pipeline scripts/notebooks
-   Versioned feature dataset (train & inference parity)
-   Feature documentation sheet
-   Drift check hooks (e.g., distribution shift vs training)

Business Impact Tie: High-signal features improve prediction accuracy → better outreach timing → higher adherence & retention lift in the Business Case revenue model. Reminder/adherence studies show targeted, personalized timing improves response vs generic blasts. ([*PMC*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4939231/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*PMC*](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3287416/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*JMC Public Relations*](https://www.jmcp.org/doi/10.18553/jmcp.2024.30.1.43?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Growth: Parameterized pipelines; automated backfills; governed feature store across products (Wave C+). Microsoft & Google maturity guides both highlight feature reuse as a scale multiplier. ([*Microsoft Learn*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

#### Stage 6: Model Development & Training (Week 7-10)

Objective: Train baseline refill prediction models; compare simple vs advanced; track experiments reproducibly.

Wave A Modeling Stack:

-   Baseline: heuristic days-supply schedule + rule features (control).
-   Tabular ML: XGBoost / LightGBM for refill lead-time regression or binary “due soon” classification.
-   Optional Ensemble: stacking w/ logistic / calibration layer.

Team Activities:

-   Split data by time (prevent leakage).
-   Train baseline & advanced models; log metrics (MAE days early/late, AUC at 7-day recall).
-   Hyperparameter sweeps (small search budget).
-   Export artifacts (ONNX) for cross-runtime deployment.

Client Collaboration:

-   Bi-weekly model review sessions.
-   Interpretability tradeoff (accuracy vs explainability).
-   Deployment constraints (latency, memory).

Deliverables:

-   Training pipeline code (replayable)
-   Experiment tracking runs
-   Model artifacts & metadata (versioned)
-   Model cards draft (summary + caveats)

Business Impact Tie: Better model quality → more precise outreach windows → higher captured refills. Controlling experiment scope limits cloud burn, FinOps recommends bounding HPO search & using Spot for non-urgent jobs. ([*FinOps Foundation*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Amazon Web Services, Inc.*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-an-end-to-end-mlops-pipeline-using-amazon-sagemaker-pipelines-github-and-github-actions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

#### Stage 7: Model Validation & Testing (Week 9-11)

Objective: Establish trust before production; measure statistical + business performance.

Wave A Validation:

-   Time-based holdout evaluation.
-   Compare to schedule heuristic baseline.
-   Business simulation: what % of refills would be flagged ≥X days early?
-   Sanity & data drift checks on inference sample.

Client Collaboration:

-   Agree success thresholds (MAE, recall, false positive rate driving wasted outreach).
-   UAT review: sample predictions vs real Rx history.
-   Edge case review (PRN meds, dose changes).

Deliverables:

-   Validation report (stats + business scenario table)
-   Threshold recommendations for outreach triggers
-   Sign-off log

Business Impact Tie: Validation gating avoids deploying models that produce noisy outreach, protects customer trust and labor ROI. Structured test scoring frameworks reduce hidden ML technical debt (Google “ML Test Score”). ([*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*TechRadar*](https://www.techradar.com/pro/breaking-silos-unifying-devops-and-mlops-into-a-unified-software-supply-chain?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

#### Stage 8: Model Deployment (Week 10-12)

Objective: Put prediction service into production with cost-aware hosting.

Wave A Deployment Pattern:

-   SageMaker Serverless Inference endpoint (scale-to-zero) for ad-hoc scoring.
-   Nightly batch scoring job writes “next refill date” to CRM table.
-   API key auth; logging of request/response.

Client Collaboration:

-   Integration sessions with engineering (consume predictions in outreach workflow).
-   Security review (IAM, PII boundaries).
-   Phased rollout by cohort.

Deliverables:

-   Deploy pipeline (CI)
-   Endpoint URL + IAM roles
-   Batch scoring job schedule
-   Runbook & rollback plan

Business Impact Tie: Hosting cost is a major OpEx lever; AWS reports up to \~50% average deployment cost reductions using newer SageMaker inference features (MME, inference components), with customer cases (e.g., Veriff) showing cost/time savings; scale-to-zero cuts idle pilot burn. ([*Amazon Web Services, Inc.*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/reduce-model-deployment-costs-by-50-on-average-using-sagemakers-latest-features/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Amazon Web Services, Inc.*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/how-veriff-decreased-deployment-time-by-80-using-amazon-sagemaker-multi-model-endpoints/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Amazon Web Services, Inc.*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/unlock-cost-savings-with-the-new-scale-down-to-zero-feature-in-amazon-sagemaker-inference/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

#### Stage 9: Model Monitoring & Evaluation (Week 13-14)

Objective: Measure real-world performance, drift, cost, and *business impact* (adherence, churn proxy).

Wave A Metrics:

-   Prediction error vs actual refill date (lag).
-   % of refills captured within outreach window.
-   Adherence uplift vs historical cohort.
-   Churn proxy: % active customers inactive \> threshold.
-   Cost / prediction (cloud tagged).

Client Collaboration:

-   Dashboard training; threshold tuning.
-   Weekly review for first month; monthly thereafter.
-   Alert routing to ops team.

Deliverables:

-   Monitoring dashboard (QuickSight / Power BI)
-   CloudWatch metric + budget alerts
-   Business KPI export for finance model

Business Impact Tie: Monitoring closes the loop, actual adherence lift feeds the ROI model; cost telemetry enables FinOps trending and Savings Plan decisions. Google CI/CD/CT and FinOps AI cost guidance both emphasize live metrics as the basis for scale decisions. ([*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*FinOps Foundation*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

#### Stage 10: Continuous Improvement (Ongoing)

Objective: Turn monitoring insight into retrain, feature updates, scale decisions, and ROI reporting.

Wave A Practice:

-   Monthly KPI + error review; manual retrain if drift \> threshold.
-   Track outreach effectiveness by channel (email/SMS).
-   Feed results into Business Case update.

Growth Path: Wave B – scheduled retrains & CI triggers; Wave C – drift-driven CT pipelines; Wave D – policy gates & governed model lifecycle w/ compliance packs (Responsible AI). Microsoft Responsible AI & MLOps Maturity docs describe these late-stage governance needs. ([*Microsoft Learn*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Microsoft*](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/RAI_Maturity_Model_Aether_Microsoft_whitepaper.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Business Impact Tie: Continuous tuning sustains adherence gains and prevents revenue decay; also key to inventory forecast accuracy. FinOps recommends quarterly forecast re-baselining using observed usage + business driver changes. ([*FinOps Foundation*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Microsoft Learn*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

Linking pipeline telemetry to business KPI financial models is a core recommendation in both Google MLOps and FinOps cost forecasting frameworks. ([*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*FinOps Foundation*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## Success Factors

### Technical Excellence

-   Automated testing coverage \>90%
-   Model performance meeting SLAs
-   Infrastructure reliability \>99.9%
-   Response time \<100ms (real-time)

### Business Alignment

## FinOps

-   Mandatory Cost Tags on all SageMaker, S3, Glue, and monitoring assets: CostCenter=KoalaRefill, Env=WaveA, Owner=DiscoverTec.
-   AWS Budgets Alert @ \$500/mo until traffic grows; revise after telemetry.
-   Defer Savings Plan Commit until ≥60 days stable utilization; then evaluate ML Savings Plan (up to \~64% discount potential).
-   Spot Training Default for non-urgent jobs (interrupt-tolerant).
-   Unit Economics Dashboard: \$ Cloud Cost / Successful Predicted Refill + \$ Benefit / \$ Cloud ratio surfaced monthly.

FinOps Foundation AI cost forecasting and cost estimation guidance emphasize tagging, phased commit, and business driver metrics as critical to avoiding runaway AI cloud spend.

## Business Case Integration

Financial Linkage Points:

-   Adherence Lift: Produced from Stage 9 metrics; feeds revenue modeling ranges (1.5 / 3 / 4.5 ppt scenarios).
-   Churn Reduction: Derived from active vs inactive script retention; refine with 6-mo data.
-   Labor Savings: Compare call volume pre/post outreach automation (Stages 8–10).
-   Inventory Savings: Use predicted demand curve vs stock (Stages 3 & 10).
-   Cloud OpEx: Actual from tags; compare Lean vs placeholder \$3K/mo budget and update ROI.

These hooks ensure that what engineering builds directly fuels the CFO-grade value model, best practice in FinOps and MLOps transformation programs.
