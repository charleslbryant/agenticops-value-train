# ADR-0013: Reasoning and Planning Strategy for Agent Decision-Making

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
The AgenticOps Value Trainâ„¢ requires sophisticated reasoning capabilities to handle complex decision-making scenarios. Agents must balance between fast, intuitive responses and deliberate, analytical reasoning depending on the complexity and criticality of the task.

Key challenges include:
- **Cognitive Load Management**: Determining when to use fast vs. slow reasoning approaches
- **Planning Complexity**: Handling multi-step workflows that require sophisticated planning
- **Decision Quality**: Ensuring high-quality decisions under varying time pressures
- **Resource Optimization**: Balancing reasoning depth with performance requirements
- **Error Prevention**: Reducing mistakes through appropriate reasoning strategies
- **Scalability**: Reasoning approaches that work across different agent types and scenarios

The dual-process theory from cognitive science suggests two thinking systems: System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, deliberate). This maps well to AI agent architectures.

## Decision
We will implement a dual-mode reasoning architecture that combines fast pattern-based responses with deliberate planning capabilities:

**System 1 Reasoning (Fast/Intuitive)**:
- Direct LLM function calling for routine operations
- Pattern recognition and cached decision lookup
- Immediate responses for well-understood scenarios
- Optimized for speed and common workflows

**System 2 Reasoning (Slow/Deliberate)**:
- Semantic Kernel's planning system for complex scenarios
- Multi-step reasoning with intermediate validation
- Fallback mechanism when System 1 approaches fail
- Used for critical decisions and novel situations

**Decision Logic**:
- Complexity heuristics determine which system to engage
- Automatic fallback from System 1 to System 2 when needed
- Context-aware switching based on agent type and scenario

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance Optimization**: Fast responses for routine operations
- **Decision Quality**: Deliberate reasoning for complex scenarios
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Appropriate reasoning depth based on task complexity
- **Error Reduction**: System 2 reasoning reduces mistakes in critical decisions
- **Resource Efficiency**: Computational resources allocated based on need
- **Cognitive Modeling**: Architecture mirrors human decision-making patterns

### Negative
- **Implementation Complexity**: Dual-mode system requires sophisticated orchestration
- **Decision Overhead**: Meta-decisions about which reasoning mode to use
- **Debugging Challenges**: Different reasoning paths make troubleshooting complex
- **Performance Variability**: Response times vary significantly based on reasoning mode

### Neutral
- **Framework Integration**: Both modes can be implemented within Semantic Kernel
- **Tuning Requirements**: Thresholds for mode switching will need empirical optimization

## Rationale
This dual-mode approach provides several advantages:

1. **Efficiency**: System 1 handles routine operations with minimal overhead
2. **Quality**: System 2 ensures thorough analysis for complex decisions
3. **Adaptability**: Agents can adjust reasoning depth to match scenario requirements
4. **Scalability**: Computational resources allocated appropriately
5. **Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms improve overall system robustness

Reasoning mode selection criteria:
- **Task Complexity**: Multi-step workflows trigger System 2 reasoning
- **Risk Level**: High-impact decisions require deliberate analysis
- **Novelty**: Unfamiliar scenarios default to planning mode
- **Time Constraints**: Urgent requests may force System 1 responses
- **Agent Type**: Some agents (like Evaluator) default to deliberate reasoning
