# ADR-0008: Adopt Microsoft Semantic Kernel for Agent Orchestration

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
The AgenticOps Value Train™ requires sophisticated agent orchestration capabilities to coordinate the seven specialized agents (Conductor, Onboarder, Lab, Studio, Ops, Evaluator, Improver) through complex workflows. Currently, this orchestration is implemented with custom Python scripts, but several forces drive the need for a more robust solution:

- **Agent Coordination Complexity**: Managing state, context, and handoffs between seven different agents requires sophisticated orchestration
- **LLM Integration**: Need for seamless integration with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, local models)
- **Plugin Architecture**: Requirement for extensible tool and skill systems that agents can dynamically utilize
- **Context Management**: Complex session-based context that must persist across agent handoffs and phase transitions
- **Planning and Execution**: Auto-Pilot requires sophisticated planning capabilities to sequence agent activities
- **Enterprise Integration**: Need for enterprise-grade security, monitoring, and compliance features
- **Performance Requirements**: Real-time agent coordination with minimal latency

Microsoft Semantic Kernel provides a mature, enterprise-ready framework specifically designed for AI agent orchestration and LLM integration, aligning well with our C# migration strategy.

## Decision
We will adopt Microsoft Semantic Kernel as the primary framework for agent orchestration, planning, and LLM integration in the AgenticOps Value Train™.

Key implementation decisions:
- **Agent Architecture**: Implement each Value Train agent as a Semantic Kernel Agent with specialized skills and tools
- **Planning System**: Utilize Semantic Kernel's planning capabilities for Auto-Pilot workflow orchestration
- **Plugin System**: Leverage Semantic Kernel's plugin architecture for tools, skills, and MCPs
- **Context Management**: Use Semantic Kernel's context and memory systems for session state management
- **Multi-Model Support**: Configure multiple LLM providers through Semantic Kernel's connector system

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Mature Framework**: Semantic Kernel provides battle-tested agent orchestration patterns
- **Enterprise Features**: Built-in security, telemetry, and enterprise integration capabilities
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Native support for OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and local model integration
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Rich plugin architecture allows easy extension of agent capabilities
- **Planning Capabilities**: Advanced planning system supports complex Auto-Pilot workflows
- **Microsoft Ecosystem**: Seamless integration with Azure services and enterprise tools
- **Active Development**: Ongoing Microsoft investment ensures long-term support and updates
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation and community support

### Negative
- **Microsoft Dependency**: Ties the project to Microsoft's strategic direction and roadmap
- **Learning Curve**: Team must learn Semantic Kernel patterns and best practices
- **Framework Overhead**: Additional abstraction layer may impact performance
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Deep integration with Semantic Kernel may limit future flexibility

### Neutral
- **Open Source**: Semantic Kernel is open source, reducing vendor lock-in concerns
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments
- **Language Support**: Supports both C# and Python, easing transition period

## Rationale
Semantic Kernel directly addresses the core challenges of agent orchestration while providing enterprise-grade capabilities that align with the Value Train's requirements:

1. **Agent Specialization**: Semantic Kernel's agent model maps well to Value Train's seven specialized agents
2. **Complex Workflows**: Planning system can handle the sophisticated workflows required by Auto-Pilot
3. **Enterprise Readiness**: Built-in security, monitoring, and compliance features
4. **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture supports the diverse tools and skills needed by different agents
5. **Performance**: Optimized for enterprise workloads with minimal latency

Alternatives considered:
- **LangChain**: Python-focused, conflicts with C# migration strategy
- **AutoGen**: Limited enterprise features and Microsoft ecosystem integration
- **Custom Framework**: High development overhead and maintenance burden
- **Haystack**: Primarily document-focused, not designed for multi-agent orchestration
- **CrewAI**: Newer framework with less enterprise validation
