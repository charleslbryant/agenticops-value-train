# ADR-0002: Implement Autonomous Agent Workflow Orchestration (Auto-Pilot)

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context

While adopting the AgenticOps Value Trainâ„¢ provides structure, manual coordination between agents and phases still creates bottlenecks and opportunities for human error. Current challenges include:

- Manual issue selection and assignment requires human intervention
- Phase transitions depend on operator availability for progression
- Inconsistent branch and folder creation leads to conflicts
- No systematic way to queue and process work items
- Context switching costs when operators manage multiple concurrent phases

The Value Train specification includes an "Auto-Pilot" system designed to autonomously operate the development pipeline, but this requires significant infrastructure to implement safely and reliably.

## Decision

We will implement an autonomous agent orchestration system (Auto-Pilot) that can:

1. **Issue Selection**: Automatically select and assign GitHub issues based on priority and availability
2. **Workspace Management**: Create isolated branch/folder structures for each phase to prevent conflicts
3. **Session Coordination**: Initialize and maintain session context across agent handoffs
4. **Quality Enforcement**: Ensure all checklist items and artifacts are complete before progression
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle failures with operator notification and manual override capabilities

### Key Components
- `select_next_issue.py`: Deterministic issue selection algorithm
- `tickets/<phase>_<id>/` folder structure for workspace isolation
- `/drive` command interface for operator control
- Integration with existing CI/CD pipeline for quality gates

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Reduced Manual Overhead**: Eliminates routine coordination tasks
- **Consistent Processing**: Standardized approach to issue selection and workspace management
- **Faster Throughput**: No waiting for human operators to advance phases
- **Conflict Prevention**: Isolated workspaces prevent merge conflicts
- **24/7 Operation**: Can process work queue continuously without human intervention

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Significant technical complexity to implement safely
- **Error Recovery**: Autonomous failures require sophisticated error handling
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Harder to troubleshoot issues in autonomous execution
- **Trust Requirements**: Team must trust system to make correct decisions

### Neutral
- **Fallback Dependency**: Must maintain manual override capabilities
- **Monitoring Overhead**: Requires monitoring and alerting infrastructure

## Rationale

Auto-Pilot implementation is justified because:

1. **Scale Requirements**: Manual coordination doesn't scale beyond small teams
2. **Error Reduction**: Removes human error from routine coordination tasks
3. **Consistency**: Ensures standardized execution of Value Train procedures
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Enables faster delivery cycles than manual coordination
5. **Agent Optimization**: Allows AI agents to focus on domain-specific work rather than coordination

### Implementation Strategy
- **Gradual Rollout**: Start with issue selection, add workspace management, then full orchestration
- **Safety First**: Extensive testing with dry-run modes before production use
- **Human Oversight**: Maintain operator controls and monitoring throughout

### Risk Mitigation
- Comprehensive testing with mock GitHub environments
- Circuit breakers to halt on repeated failures
- Manual override capabilities at every stage
- Detailed logging and audit trails

- Requires quality gate enforcement (future ADR for git hooks)
- Depends on session context management approach (future ADR)
