# ADR-0016: Secure Command-Line Tool Integration

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
Value Train agents require access to various command-line tools and utilities to perform their specialized functions. These tools include development utilities, system administration commands, deployment scripts, and analysis tools. However, providing CLI access to AI agents introduces significant security risks that must be carefully managed.

Key security concerns include:
- **System Access**: CLI tools can access system resources and sensitive data
- **Command Injection**: Improperly validated commands could be exploited
- **Privilege Escalation**: Tools might require elevated permissions
- **Resource Consumption**: Unrestricted tool usage could impact system performance
- **Audit Requirements**: All command execution must be logged and traceable
- **Error Handling**: Failed commands should not expose sensitive information

The challenge is providing necessary functionality while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards.

## Decision
We will implement a secure command-line tool integration system with comprehensive whitelisting, sandboxing, and monitoring capabilities via MCP.

Security architecture:
- **Command Whitelisting**: Pre-approved list of allowed commands and parameters
- **Parameter Validation**: Strict validation of all command parameters
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Commands run in controlled environments with limited privileges
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and execution time constraints
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail of all command executions
- **Error Sanitization**: Sensitive information removed from error messages

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Controlled Access**: Agents can use necessary tools without compromising security
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete traceability of all command executions
- **Resource Protection**: System resources protected from abuse or runaway processes
- **Flexible Integration**: New tools can be added through controlled approval process
- **Enterprise Security**: Meets enterprise security standards and compliance requirements
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of failures with appropriate logging

### Negative
- **Implementation Complexity**: Sophisticated security controls require significant development
- **Performance Overhead**: Sandboxing and validation introduce latency
- **Operational Overhead**: Whitelist management requires ongoing maintenance
- **Limited Flexibility**: Some legitimate use cases may be blocked by security controls

### Neutral
- **Tool Independence**: Security layer can be applied to various CLI tools
- **Scalability**: Security model scales with additional tools and agents

## Rationale
Secure CLI integration is essential for agent functionality while maintaining security:

1. **Functional Requirements**: Agents need access to development and system tools
2. **Security Imperative**: Enterprise environments require strict security controls
3. **Compliance**: Audit trails and access controls support regulatory requirements
4. **Risk Management**: Controlled approach minimizes security exposure
5. **Operational Excellence**: Proper monitoring and error handling ensure reliability

Security implementation patterns:
- **Command Templates**: Pre-defined command patterns with parameter slots
- **Permission Models**: Role-based access to different tool categories
- **Execution Environments**: Isolated containers or sandboxes for command execution
- **Monitoring Integration**: Real-time monitoring of command execution and resource usage
