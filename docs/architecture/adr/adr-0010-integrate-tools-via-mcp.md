# ADR-0010: Integrate Tools and Skills via Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
The AgenticOps Value Trainâ„¢ agents require access to diverse tools and capabilities to perform their specialized functions. Each agent (Conductor, Onboarder, Lab, Studio, Ops, Evaluator, Improver) needs specific tools while maintaining secure, structured access to external systems and services.

Current challenges include:
- **Tool Discovery**: Agents need dynamic discovery of available tools and capabilities
- **Structured Invocation**: Tools must be callable with proper parameter validation and type safety
- **Security Boundaries**: Tool access must be controlled and sandboxed appropriately
- **Extensibility**: New tools should be easily added without core system modifications
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Tools must work consistently across different environments
- **Integration Complexity**: Each tool currently requires custom integration code

Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized approach for connecting AI systems with external tools and data sources, offering structured discovery, invocation, and security models.

## Decision
We will adopt Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the primary mechanism for integrating tools, skills, and external capabilities with Value Train agents.

Implementation approach:
- **MCP Server Architecture**: Tools exposed as MCP servers with standardized interfaces
- **Agent Tool Discovery**: Agents discover available tools through MCP protocol
- **Structured Invocation**: All tool calls use MCP's type-safe parameter system
- **Security Model**: MCP's built-in sandboxing and permission system
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Extensible architecture for third-party tool integration

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Standardized Integration**: Consistent approach to tool integration across all agents
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for tool parameters and return values
- **Security**: Built-in sandboxing and permission management
- **Discoverability**: Agents can dynamically discover available tools and capabilities
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new tools without core system changes
- **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across different operating systems
- **Community Ecosystem**: Leverage existing MCP tools and servers

### Negative
- **Protocol Dependency**: Ties tool integration to MCP protocol evolution
- **Learning Curve**: Team must learn MCP patterns and implementation details
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional protocol layer may introduce latency
- **Limited Ecosystem**: MCP is relatively new with fewer available tools

### Neutral
- **Open Standard**: MCP is an open protocol, reducing vendor lock-in
- **Implementation Flexibility**: Multiple MCP client and server implementations available

## Rationale
MCP addresses key challenges in AI agent tool integration:

1. **Structured Discovery**: Agents can programmatically discover tool capabilities
2. **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents runtime errors in tool invocation
3. **Security**: Built-in permission system and sandboxing capabilities
4. **Standardization**: Industry-standard approach to AI tool integration
5. **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture supports diverse tool ecosystems

Key tool categories to implement via MCP:
- **File Operations**: Document management, code editing, artifact creation
- **External APIs**: GitHub, cloud services, monitoring systems
- **Development Tools**: Compilers, linters, test runners, deployment systems
- **Data Processing**: Analysis tools, transformation utilities, validation systems
- **Communication**: Email, notifications, reporting systems
