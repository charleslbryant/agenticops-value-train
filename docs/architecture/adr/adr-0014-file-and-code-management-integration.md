# ADR-0014: File and Code Management Integration Strategy

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
The AgenticOps Value Trainâ„¢ agents must efficiently manage files, code, and documentation throughout the development lifecycle. Different agents have varying file management needs, from document creation to code analysis and artifact generation.

Key requirements include:
- **File Operations**: Create, read, update, delete files with appropriate permissions
- **Code Management**: Syntax analysis, refactoring, and code generation capabilities
- **Documentation**: Generate and maintain technical documentation and artifacts
- **Version Control**: Integration with Git for code and document versioning
- **Security**: Controlled access to file systems with appropriate sandboxing
- **Performance**: Efficient file operations that don't block agent workflows
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent behavior across different operating systems

Current challenges include providing secure, efficient file access while maintaining the structured approach required by the Value Train methodology.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive file and code management strategy that combines native file operations with Claude Code SDK integration via MCP:

**Core File Operations**:
- Native file system access through Semantic Kernel plugins
- Secure sandboxing with configurable permissions per agent type
- Structured file operations aligned with Value Train artifact requirements

**Advanced Code Management**:
- Claude Code SDK integration via MCP for sophisticated code operations
- Semantic file search and analysis capabilities
- Automated code documentation and analysis features

**Integration Approach**:
- File operations exposed as standardized MCP tools
- Agent-specific permissions and access controls
- Seamless integration with version control systems

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Comprehensive Capabilities**: Full spectrum of file and code management operations
- **Advanced Code Features**: Leverage Claude Code's sophisticated analysis capabilities
- **Security**: Controlled access with appropriate sandboxing and permissions
- **Integration**: Seamless work with existing development workflows
- **Standardization**: Consistent file operations across all agent types
- **Performance**: Optimized operations for different file types and sizes

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple integration points increase system complexity
- **Dependencies**: Reliance on external tools (Claude Code SDK) for advanced features
- **Security Considerations**: File system access requires careful permission management
- **Performance Overhead**: MCP integration may introduce latency for file operations

### Neutral
- **Tool Flexibility**: Can substitute or extend with other code analysis tools
- **Platform Support**: Works across different development environments

## Rationale
This hybrid approach provides the best of both worlds:

1. **Native Performance**: Direct file operations for routine tasks
2. **Advanced Capabilities**: Claude Code SDK for sophisticated code analysis
3. **Security**: Controlled access patterns appropriate for each agent type
4. **Extensibility**: MCP integration allows for additional tool integration
5. **Developer Experience**: Familiar patterns for development teams

File management patterns by agent type:
- **Conductor**: Project structure management, artifact coordination
- **Lab**: Data file processing, analysis notebooks, experiment results
- **Studio**: Code generation, architecture documentation, design files
- **Ops**: Configuration files, deployment scripts, infrastructure code
- **Evaluator**: Test results, quality reports, validation artifacts
- **Improver**: Refactoring suggestions, optimization reports
