# ADR-0015: Web Search Integration via MCP

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
Value Train agents require access to current information, documentation, and research capabilities to make informed decisions and provide up-to-date guidance. Different agents have varying needs for web search functionality:

- **Onboarder**: Research industry trends, competitive analysis, technology assessment
- **Lab**: Find technical documentation, research papers, data analysis techniques
- **Studio**: Discover architectural patterns, technology comparisons, best practices
- **Ops**: Infrastructure documentation, deployment guides, troubleshooting resources
- **Evaluator**: Benchmark data, quality standards, validation methodologies
- **Improver**: Performance optimization techniques, emerging technologies

Current challenges include providing secure, controlled web access while maintaining response quality and managing costs associated with web search operations.

## Decision
We will implement web search capabilities through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration with appropriate fallback mechanisms and security controls.

Implementation approach:
- **Primary Integration**: Web search via dedicated MCP server
- **Fallback Support**: Multiple search providers for reliability
- **Content Filtering**: Appropriate content filtering and safety measures
- **Cost Management**: Usage limits and optimization for different agent types
- **Security**: Controlled access patterns with appropriate sandboxing

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Current Information**: Agents have access to up-to-date information and documentation
- **Enhanced Decision Making**: Better informed recommendations and analysis
- **Research Capabilities**: Comprehensive research support for complex decisions
- **Standardized Access**: Consistent web search interface across all agents
- **Security**: Controlled access through MCP protocol with built-in safety measures
- **Flexibility**: Multiple provider support reduces dependency on single service

### Negative
- **Cost Implications**: Web search operations incur usage-based costs
- **Performance Impact**: Network requests introduce latency to agent responses
- **Quality Variability**: Search result quality depends on external providers
- **Security Risks**: Web content access requires careful filtering and validation

### Neutral
- **Provider Independence**: MCP abstraction allows switching between search providers
- **Integration Complexity**: Additional infrastructure component to manage

## Rationale
Web search capability is essential for keeping agents informed and effective:

1. **Information Currency**: Access to latest information, documentation, and trends
2. **Decision Quality**: Better informed decisions based on current best practices
3. **Research Support**: Comprehensive background research for complex problems
4. **Competitive Intelligence**: Understanding of market conditions and alternatives
5. **Technical Support**: Access to latest documentation and troubleshooting guides

Search usage patterns by agent:
- **Strategic Queries**: High-level trend analysis and competitive research
- **Technical Queries**: Specific implementation guidance and troubleshooting
- **Validation Queries**: Verification of facts and current best practices
- **Discovery Queries**: Exploration of new technologies and approaches
