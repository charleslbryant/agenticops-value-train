# ADR-0001: Adopt AgenticOps Value Train™ Methodology

## Status
**Accepted**

## Context

Software development teams struggle with context switching, unclear handoffs, and inconsistent AI agent utilization across ML pipelines. Traditional development workflows don't account for AI agents as first-class participants in the development process, leading to:

- Manual coordination between human operators and AI agents
- Inconsistent development environments and tooling
- Unclear phase transitions and completion criteria
- Lack of structured agent roles and responsibilities
- Poor traceability of decisions and artifacts across project phases
- No standardized approach to AI-driven development workflows

The AgenticOps Value Train™ provides a structured methodology for managing AI agent development workflows across the entire ML pipeline, with defined agent roles, phase-based progression, and automated orchestration.

## Decision

We will adopt the AgenticOps Value Train™ methodology as our primary framework for AI-driven development workflows. This includes:

1. **Agent Role Structure**: Implement seven specialized agent roles (Conductor, Onboarder, Lab, Studio, Ops, Evaluator, Improver) with clear responsibilities
2. **Phase-Based Pipeline**: Follow the 18-phase progression from Opportunity Triage through Improvement/Retraining
3. **Mode System**: Use bounded operating contexts (/intake, /discover, /scope, /design, /build, /evaluate, /deliver, /operate, /improve) with specific tools and checklists
4. **Session Management**: Maintain structured session context with YAML front-matter for state tracking
5. **Artifact Management**: Organize deliverables by phase with standardized paths and formats

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Structured Workflow**: Clear progression through development phases with defined entry/exit criteria
- **Agent Specialization**: Each agent has specific responsibilities and tools, reducing context switching
- **Improved Handoffs**: Standardized session context and artifacts enable smooth transitions between agents
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in validation at each phase prevents regression and ensures completeness
- **Traceability**: All decisions, artifacts, and progress tracked in structured format
- **Scalability**: Framework supports multiple concurrent projects and team members

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team must learn new methodology and tooling
- **Initial Setup**: Significant upfront investment to implement all Value Train components
- **Process Overhead**: Additional structure may slow initial development velocity
- **Tool Dependencies**: Requires specific tooling and infrastructure to operate effectively

### Neutral
- **Methodology Lock-in**: Committing to Value Train approach limits flexibility to adopt other frameworks
- **Documentation Burden**: Requires maintaining extensive documentation for modes, checklists, and procedures

## Rationale

The AgenticOps Value Train™ was selected over alternatives because it:

1. **Addresses Core Problems**: Directly solves context switching, handoff issues, and AI agent coordination challenges
2. **Proven Structure**: Based on established ML pipeline best practices with agent-specific enhancements
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles entire lifecycle from opportunity assessment through deployment and improvement
4. **Automation-Ready**: Designed for autonomous agent operation with minimal human intervention
5. **Flexibility**: Mode system allows adaptation to different project types and contexts

### Alternatives Considered
- **Traditional Git Workflows**: Insufficient for AI agent coordination and ML-specific needs
- **Custom Framework**: Higher development cost and maintenance burden
- **Existing MLOps Platforms**: Focus on technical pipeline, not agent-driven development workflow

## Related Decisions
- Will require ADR for Auto-Pilot implementation (autonomous agent orchestration)
- Will require ADR for session context management approach
- Will require ADR for quality gate enforcement strategy
