# ADR-0011: Agent Communication Using Semantic Kernel Handoff Patterns

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
The AgenticOps Value Trainâ„¢ involves seven specialized agents that must coordinate seamlessly through complex workflows. Each agent has distinct responsibilities, but success depends on effective handoffs and communication between agents.

Current challenges include:
- **Context Preservation**: Maintaining session state and context across agent handoffs
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinating multi-agent workflows with dependencies
- **State Synchronization**: Ensuring consistent state across distributed agent operations
- **Error Handling**: Managing failures and rollbacks in multi-agent scenarios
- **Performance**: Minimizing latency in agent-to-agent communication
- **Scalability**: Supporting concurrent agent operations without conflicts

Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication patterns in the Value Train specification require sophisticated orchestration capabilities that go beyond simple message passing.

## Decision
We will implement agent communication using Semantic Kernel's Handoff orchestration patterns, providing structured agent-to-agent coordination within the established framework.

Key implementation decisions:
- **Handoff Orchestration**: Use Semantic Kernel's agent handoff capabilities for workflow coordination
- **Shared Context**: Maintain session state through Semantic Kernel's context management
- **Async Communication**: Support both synchronous and asynchronous agent interactions
- **Error Recovery**: Implement rollback and retry mechanisms for failed handoffs
- **Monitoring Integration**: Full observability of agent interactions and handoffs

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Framework Integration**: Leverages existing Semantic Kernel infrastructure
- **Structured Handoffs**: Formal patterns for agent coordination and state transfer
- **Context Preservation**: Built-in support for maintaining session state across agents
- **Error Handling**: Sophisticated error recovery and rollback capabilities
- **Performance**: Optimized communication patterns within single framework
- **Observability**: Integrated monitoring and tracing of agent interactions

### Negative
- **Framework Dependency**: Ties communication patterns to Semantic Kernel implementation
- **Complexity**: Advanced orchestration patterns require careful design
- **Learning Curve**: Team must master Semantic Kernel's handoff patterns
- **Debugging**: Multi-agent interactions can be challenging to troubleshoot

### Neutral
- **Consistency**: Uniform approach to agent communication across the system
- **Extensibility**: Can be extended as Semantic Kernel adds new capabilities

## Rationale
Using Semantic Kernel's handoff patterns provides several advantages:

1. **Framework Consistency**: Aligns with our adoption of Semantic Kernel for agent orchestration
2. **Proven Patterns**: Leverages established patterns for multi-agent coordination
3. **Context Management**: Built-in support for complex session state management
4. **Enterprise Features**: Monitoring, security, and reliability features included
5. **Performance**: Optimized communication within single framework reduces overhead

Key communication patterns to implement:
- **Sequential Handoffs**: Linear agent progression through Value Train phases
- **Parallel Coordination**: Multiple agents working concurrently with synchronization
- **Conditional Routing**: Dynamic agent selection based on workflow state
- **Error Escalation**: Automatic escalation to Conductor agent for conflict resolution
