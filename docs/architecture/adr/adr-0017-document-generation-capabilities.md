# ADR-0017: Document Generation Capabilities

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
The AgenticOps Value Trainâ„¢ generates extensive documentation throughout the development lifecycle, including technical specifications, business documents, reports, and compliance artifacts. Different agents require sophisticated document generation capabilities to produce high-quality, structured outputs.

Document generation requirements include:
- **Technical Documentation**: Architecture docs, API specifications, deployment guides
- **Business Documents**: PRDs, revenue projections, executive summaries, proposals
- **Compliance Artifacts**: Audit reports, security assessments, regulatory filings
- **Project Artifacts**: Status reports, quality assessments, retrospectives
- **Structured Formats**: Support for multiple output formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML, Word)
- **Template Systems**: Reusable templates with variable substitution
- **Version Control**: Integration with Git for document versioning and collaboration

Current challenges include ensuring consistent formatting, maintaining template libraries, and generating professional-quality documents that meet enterprise standards.

## Decision
We will implement a comprehensive document generation system using a combination of template engines and structured document builders integrated via MCP.

Architecture components:
- **Template Engine**: Structured templates with variable substitution and logic
- **Multi-Format Output**: Support for Markdown, PDF, HTML, and Office formats
- **Document Builder CLI**: Specialized command-line tools for complex document generation
- **Integration Layer**: MCP-based integration for seamless agent access
- **Version Control**: Automatic Git integration for document versioning

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Professional Quality**: High-quality, consistently formatted documents
- **Efficiency**: Automated generation reduces manual document creation time
- **Consistency**: Standardized templates ensure uniform document structure
- **Multi-Format Support**: Flexibility to generate documents in required formats
- **Version Control**: Integrated tracking of document changes and evolution
- **Scalability**: Template-based approach scales across different document types

### Negative
- **Template Maintenance**: Template libraries require ongoing maintenance and updates
- **Complexity**: Multi-format support adds implementation complexity
- **Tool Dependencies**: Reliance on external document generation tools
- **Quality Control**: Automated generation may require human review for quality

### Neutral
- **Format Flexibility**: Can adapt to changing document format requirements
- **Tool Integration**: Can incorporate various document generation tools as needed

## Rationale
Automated document generation provides significant value:

1. **Efficiency**: Reduces time spent on manual document creation and formatting
2. **Consistency**: Ensures all documents follow established standards and templates
3. **Quality**: Professional formatting and structure improve document quality
4. **Compliance**: Standardized templates support regulatory and audit requirements
5. **Scalability**: Template approach scales across projects and document types

Document generation patterns by agent:
- **Conductor**: Project plans, status reports, executive summaries
- **Onboarder**: Proposals, SOWs, client presentations, readiness assessments
- **Lab**: Analysis reports, data profiles, experiment documentation
- **Studio**: Architecture documents, API specifications, design documents
- **Ops**: Deployment guides, configuration documentation, runbooks
- **Evaluator**: Quality reports, test results, compliance assessments
- **Improver**: Optimization reports, recommendations, roadmaps
