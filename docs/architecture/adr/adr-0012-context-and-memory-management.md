# ADR-0012: Context and Memory Management Strategy

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
The AgenticOps Value Trainâ„¢ requires sophisticated memory and context management to support complex multi-agent workflows with persistent session state. Agents must maintain both short-term context for immediate interactions and long-term memory for project continuity.

Key requirements include:
- **Conversation History**: Maintaining coherent conversation context within agent interactions
- **Session Persistence**: Preserving project state across agent handoffs and system restarts
- **Cross-Agent Context**: Sharing relevant context between different specialized agents
- **Long-term Memory**: Persistent storage of project artifacts, decisions, and learnings
- **Performance**: Efficient context retrieval without sacrificing response times
- **Scalability**: Memory systems that scale with project complexity and duration

Current challenges include managing context across distributed agents while maintaining performance and ensuring data consistency.

## Decision
We will implement a dual-layer memory architecture using Semantic Kernel's memory and context management capabilities:

**Short-term Memory (Conversation History)**:
- Use Semantic Kernel's ChatHistory for immediate conversation context
- Maintain separate conversation threads per agent type
- Implement context windowing to manage token limits
- Support context compression for long-running sessions

**Long-term Memory (Persistent State)**:
- Utilize vector stores for semantic search of project artifacts
- Implement structured storage for session state and metadata
- Use embeddings for intelligent context retrieval
- Maintain audit trails for all context modifications

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Context Continuity**: Seamless context preservation across agent interactions
- **Intelligent Retrieval**: Semantic search enables relevant context discovery
- **Performance Optimization**: Layered approach balances immediacy and comprehensiveness
- **Audit Trails**: Complete history of context evolution for debugging and compliance
- **Scalability**: Vector stores handle large-scale project memory efficiently
- **Framework Integration**: Leverages Semantic Kernel's built-in memory capabilities

### Negative
- **Storage Overhead**: Persistent memory requires additional infrastructure
- **Complexity**: Dual-layer architecture adds implementation complexity
- **Performance Trade-offs**: Context retrieval may introduce latency
- **Cost**: Vector storage and embedding generation have associated costs

### Neutral
- **Vendor Flexibility**: Multiple vector store providers supported
- **Data Portability**: Context can be exported and migrated if needed

## Rationale
The dual-layer approach addresses different memory requirements:

1. **Immediate Context**: ChatHistory provides fast access to recent interactions
2. **Project Memory**: Vector stores enable semantic search across project history
3. **Performance Balance**: Hot/cold memory pattern optimizes for common access patterns
4. **Compliance**: Persistent storage supports audit and regulatory requirements

Memory management patterns:
- **Context Compression**: Summarize older conversation history to manage token limits
- **Relevance Scoring**: Prioritize context based on current workflow phase
- **Cross-Agent Sharing**: Selective context sharing based on agent roles and permissions
- **Intelligent Pruning**: Remove irrelevant context while preserving important decisions
