# ADR-0018: API Integration Strategy

## Status
**Proposed**

## Context
Value Train agents must integrate with numerous external APIs and services to perform their functions effectively. These integrations include cloud services, development tools, monitoring systems, and business applications.

Key integration requirements include:
- **GitHub API**: Issue management, repository operations, CI/CD integration
- **Cloud APIs**: AWS, Azure, GCP for infrastructure management and deployment
- **Monitoring APIs**: Application performance monitoring, logging, and alerting systems
- **Business APIs**: CRM systems, project management tools, communication platforms
- **AI/ML APIs**: External AI services, model repositories, and analysis tools
- **Standardization**: Consistent approach to API authentication, error handling, and rate limiting
- **Security**: Secure credential management and access control

Current challenges include managing diverse API specifications, handling authentication variations, and providing consistent error handling across different external services.

## Decision
We will implement a standardized API integration strategy using OpenAPI specifications with MCP wrappers for consistent agent access.

Integration architecture:
- **OpenAPI First**: Use OpenAPI specifications as the foundation for API integration
- **MCP Wrappers**: Standardized MCP tools for API access with consistent interfaces
- **Authentication Management**: Centralized credential management with appropriate security
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and retry logic across all API integrations
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting and quota management
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API documentation from OpenAPI specs

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Standardization**: Consistent approach to API integration across all external services
- **Type Safety**: OpenAPI specifications provide strong typing for API interactions
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated documentation improves developer experience
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Security**: Centralized credential management with appropriate access controls
- **Maintainability**: OpenAPI specs make API changes easier to track and manage

### Negative
- **OpenAPI Dependency**: Requires OpenAPI specifications for all integrated APIs
- **Implementation Overhead**: Additional abstraction layer adds complexity
- **Performance Impact**: MCP wrapper layer may introduce latency
- **Specification Maintenance**: OpenAPI specs require ongoing maintenance as APIs evolve

### Neutral
- **Tool Flexibility**: Can accommodate various API types through OpenAPI specifications
- **Provider Independence**: Abstraction layer reduces vendor lock-in

## Rationale
Standardized API integration provides several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Uniform approach to API integration reduces development complexity
2. **Type Safety**: OpenAPI specifications provide compile-time validation
3. **Documentation**: Self-documenting APIs improve maintainability
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns across all external integrations
5. **Security**: Centralized authentication and authorization management

API integration patterns by category:
- **Version Control**: GitHub API for repository and issue management
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud provider APIs for resource management
- **Monitoring**: APM and logging APIs for system observability
- **Communication**: Slack, Teams, email APIs for notifications
- **Business Systems**: CRM, project management, and business intelligence APIs
