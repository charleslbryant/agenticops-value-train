# Extending Claude Commands - Developer Guide

This guide explains how to create, modify, and extend Claude slash commands for the Value Train system. Claude commands are the primary interface for mode-based operations and agent interactions.

## Understanding Claude Commands

### What Are Claude Commands?

Claude commands are slash commands (like `/intake`, `/discover`) that:
- **Switch Claude into specific modes** with defined behaviors and constraints
- **Load relevant context** including rules, session state, and project information
- **Guide structured workflows** through comprehensive checklists and validation
- **Enforce quality gates** before allowing mode transitions
- **Integrate with CLI commands** for deterministic business logic

### Command Architecture

```
Claude Command (/intake)
â”œâ”€â”€ YAML Front Matter (metadata, tools, description)
â”œâ”€â”€ Mode Header & Status Display
â”œâ”€â”€ Workflow Description & Context Loading
â”œâ”€â”€ TodoWrite Checklist (required activities)
â”œâ”€â”€ Mode-Specific Rules & Guidelines
â”œâ”€â”€ Exit Criteria & Transition Rules
â””â”€â”€ Quality Gates & Validation
```

### Three-Layer Integration

Claude commands work within a three-layer architecture:

1. **Documentation Layer** - Human-readable command definitions
2. **LLM Guidance Layer** - Commands guide AI behavior through structured prompts
3. **CLI Enforcement Layer** - Deterministic validation and rule enforcement

## Command Structure Standards

### File Location and Naming

```
/.claude/commands/
â”œâ”€â”€ intake.md          # Core mode commands
â”œâ”€â”€ discover.md
â”œâ”€â”€ scope.md
â”œâ”€â”€ design.md
â”œâ”€â”€ build.md           # Or extract.md, features.md, train.md for ML
â”œâ”€â”€ evaluate.md
â”œâ”€â”€ deliver.md
â”œâ”€â”€ operate.md
â”œâ”€â”€ improve.md
â””â”€â”€ utility/           # Utility commands (future)
    â”œâ”€â”€ plan.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ clear.md
    â””â”€â”€ begin.md
```

### Required Front Matter

Every Claude command must start with YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
description: Brief description of what this mode does (required)
allowed-tools: Read, Write, TodoWrite, Bash(git:*), Bash(gh:*), WebSearch, WebFetch
---
```

**Key Fields:**
- **`description`**: Clear, concise explanation of the command's purpose
- **`allowed-tools`**: Specific tools Claude can use in this mode (security constraint)

### Standard Command Template

```markdown
---
description: [Brief description of mode purpose]
allowed-tools: Read, Write, TodoWrite, Bash(git:*), Bash(gh:*), WebSearch, WebFetch
---

# [Mode] Mode - [Agent] Agent

Always start your chats with `ðŸ¤– [[Mode] Mode - [Agent] Agent]`

Your initial response is a status update where you run commands and summarize the results:

```
ðŸ¤– [[Mode] Mode - [Agent] Agent]

## Current Status
**Active PRD/CRD:**
!`gh issue list --label "PRD,now" --limit 1 || gh issue list --label "CRD,now" --limit 1`

**Current Branch:**
!`git branch --show-current`

**Session Context:**
!`cat docs/session-context/ACTIVE_SESSION.md | head -20`
```

## Workflow

[Detailed explanation of what this mode does, when to use it, and how it fits into the Value Train pipeline]

### Mode Context Files

Before starting the checklist, reread all mode context files. This ensures clean memory boundaries between modes.

**Rule Files:**
* `/docs/rules/session-workflow.md`
* `/docs/rules/task-management.md`
* `/docs/rules/documentation-rules.md`
* `/docs/product/`

**Session Context Files:**
* `/docs/session-context/CURRENT_STATE.md`
* `/docs/session-context/ACTIVE_SESSION.md`

### [Mode] Checklist (TodoWrite)

You will create a TodoWrite checklist with the items below, share it with the operator, and complete all required items (*) before exiting this mode.

0. **Read Mode Context Files***: Read all rule and session context files
1. **[Required Activity]***: [Specific, measurable activity]

```

## Creating New Commands

### 1. Identify Command Requirements

Before creating a new command, determine:

**Mode Purpose**
- What specific problem does this mode solve?
- When in the Value Train pipeline does this occur?
- What agent role is responsible for this mode?

**Context Adaptations**
- How does this mode differ for business vs. ML vs. software contexts?
- What different artifacts or approaches are needed?
- Are there context-specific rules or constraints?

**Integration Points**
- What commands typically precede this mode?
- What commands can follow this mode?
- How does this integrate with CLI commands and validation?

### 2. Define Mode Checklist

Create comprehensive checklist covering:

**Entry Activities**
- Context loading and validation
- Prerequisites verification
- Stakeholder identification

**Core Activities**
- Main work items specific to this mode
- Artifact creation requirements
- Quality validation steps

**Exit Activities**
- Deliverable completion verification
- Session context updates
- Handoff preparation

### 3. Implement Command File

Create the command file following the standard template:

```bash
# Create new command file
touch .claude/commands/[new-mode].md

# Follow naming convention: lowercase, hyphen-separated if needed
# Examples: discover.md, build.md, extract-data.md
```

**Implementation Checklist:**
- [ ] YAML front matter with description and allowed tools
- [ ] Mode header with agent assignment
- [ ] Status update commands for context loading
- [ ] Comprehensive workflow description
- [ ] Rule file references for context loading
- [ ] TodoWrite checklist with all required activities
- [ ] Context-specific adaptations (business/ML/software)
- [ ] Mode rules and constraints
- [ ] Exit criteria and transition rules
- [ ] Quality gates and validation requirements

### 4. Create Supporting Documentation

**Required User Guide**
Create user guide at `/docs/user-guides/claude-commands/[mode].md`:

```markdown
# /[mode] Command - User Guide

[Comprehensive user documentation following the intake.md pattern]

## When to Use /[mode]
## What /[mode] Does  
## How Context Detection Works
## Using the /[mode] Command
## The [Mode] Process
## Required Checklist Items
## Quality Standards
## Transitioning from /[mode]
## Examples and Troubleshooting
```

**Optional Developer Guide**
For complex modes, create developer guide at `/docs/developer-guides/claude-commands/[mode]-development.md`

### 5. Integrate with CLI Commands

Define corresponding CLI commands for deterministic logic:

```csharp
// ValueTrain.Application/Features/[Mode]Mode/
public class Execute[Mode]Command : IRequest<Execute[Mode]Response>
{
    public string Context { get; set; }
    public int? IssueId { get; set; }
    // Mode-specific parameters
}

public class Execute[Mode]CommandHandler : IRequestHandler<Execute[Mode]Command, Execute[Mode]Response>
{
    public async Task<Execute[Mode]Response> Handle(Execute[Mode]Command request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Implement deterministic mode logic
        // - Context detection
        // - Rule validation  
        // - Artifact generation
        // - Quality checks
    }
}
```

## Modifying Existing Commands

### Safe Modification Process

1. **Read Current Implementation** - Understand existing behavior and dependencies
2. **Identify Impact** - Determine what changes and what remains the same
3. **Update Incrementally** - Make small, testable changes
4. **Validate Behavior** - Test with different contexts and scenarios
5. **Update Documentation** - Ensure user guide reflects changes

### Common Modifications

#### Adding Context-Specific Behavior

```markdown
### Context-Specific Adaptations

#### [New Context] Context
- Focus on [context-specific concerns]
- Document [context-specific requirements]  
- **Output**: [Context-appropriate artifact using new template]
```

#### Adding New Activities

```markdown
### [Mode] Checklist (TodoWrite)

[Existing items...]
X. **[New Required Activity]***: [Clear description of new requirement]
Y. **[New Optional Activity]**: [Description of optional enhancement]
```

#### Updating Quality Gates

```markdown
### Mode Exit Requirement

Before exiting this mode:
* [Existing requirements...]
* [New requirement with clear validation criteria]
```

### Backward Compatibility

When modifying commands:
- **Preserve core workflow** - Don't break existing user expectations
- **Add, don't remove** - Extend functionality rather than replacing it
- **Clear migration path** - If changes are breaking, provide clear guidance
- **Version documentation** - Update user guides to reflect changes

## Advanced Command Patterns

### Multi-Context Commands

For commands that significantly differ by context:

```markdown
### Workflow

You are now in **[Mode] Mode** as the **[Agent] Agent**. This mode adapts based on task type:

**Business Context**: [Business-specific workflow description]
**ML Engineering Context**: [ML-specific workflow description]  
**Software Engineering Context**: [Software-specific workflow description]

### Context Detection and Routing

1. **Analyze Task Context** - Examine issue labels, description, and project type
2. **Select Appropriate Workflow** - Choose business, ML, or software approach
3. **Load Context-Specific Rules** - Reference appropriate rule files and templates
4. **Execute Adapted Checklist** - Follow context-appropriate activities
```

### Command Composition

For commands that include sub-workflows:

```markdown
### [Mode] Workflow

This mode consists of multiple phases:

#### Phase 1: [Sub-workflow Name]
[Phase-specific checklist and activities]

#### Phase 2: [Sub-workflow Name]  
[Phase-specific checklist and activities]

#### Phase 3: [Sub-workflow Name]
[Phase-specific checklist and activities]

### Phase Transition Rules
- Complete all Phase N activities before proceeding to Phase N+1
- Validate Phase N deliverables before transition
- Update session context at each phase boundary
```

### Command Dependencies

For commands with strict ordering requirements:

```markdown
### Entry Criteria

Before entering [Mode] Mode, ensure:
- [ ] Previous mode ([Previous Mode]) completed successfully
- [ ] Required artifacts from previous mode are validated
- [ ] Session context contains necessary information from previous work

### Dependency Validation

Use CLI commands to validate prerequisites:
```bash
# Validate previous mode completion
agenticops session validate --mode [previous-mode] --complete

# Check required artifacts exist
agenticops artifacts check --phase [previous-phase] --strict
```
```

## CLI Integration Patterns

### Context Detection Integration

```markdown
### Mode Context Files

Before starting the checklist, use CLI commands for deterministic context detection:

```bash
# Detect work context automatically
!`agenticops context detect --issue-id current --format yaml`

# Validate context detection result
!`agenticops context validate --detected [context] --issue-id current`
```

**Rule Files** (loaded based on detected context):
* Base rules: `/docs/rules/session-workflow.md`, `/docs/rules/task-management.md`
* Context-specific rules: `/docs/rules/contexts/[detected-context]-context.md`
```

### Artifact Management Integration

```markdown
### [Mode] Checklist (TodoWrite)

X. **Create Structured Document***: 
   ```bash
   # Generate appropriate template based on context
   !`agenticops artifacts create --template auto --context [detected-context] --mode [current-mode]`
   
   # Validate artifact completeness
   !`agenticops artifacts validate --artifact [artifact-path] --template [template-name]`
   ```

Y. **Validate Artifact Quality***:
   ```bash
   # Check artifact against quality standards
   !`agenticops quality check --artifact [artifact-path] --mode [current-mode]`
   ```
```

### Rule Enforcement Integration

```markdown
### Mode Rules

* **Deterministic Rule Enforcement**: Critical business logic validated by CLI
  ```bash
  # Validate all applicable rules for current mode and context
  !`agenticops rules validate --mode [current-mode] --context [detected-context]`
  
  # Check specific rule compliance
  !`agenticops rules check --rule [rule-name] --current-state`
  ```

* **Quality Gate Validation**: All quality gates must pass before mode exit
  ```bash
  # Validate mode completion before transition
  !`agenticops mode validate --mode [current-mode] --exit-criteria`
  ```
```

## Testing Commands

### Manual Testing Process

1. **Context Variation Testing**
   - Test command with business context scenarios
   - Test command with ML engineering context scenarios  
   - Test command with software engineering context scenarios

2. **Workflow Integration Testing**
   - Test transitions from expected previous modes
   - Test transitions to expected next modes
   - Test error handling for invalid transitions

3. **Checklist Completeness Testing**
   - Verify all required activities can be completed
   - Test partial completion and resumption
   - Validate quality gates and exit criteria

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Validate command file format
agenticops commands validate --command [mode]

# Test context detection with command
agenticops commands test --command [mode] --context business
agenticops commands test --command [mode] --context ml-engineering  
agenticops commands test --command [mode] --context software-engineering

# Validate command integration
agenticops commands integration-test --workflow intake,discover,scope
```

## Best Practices

### Command Design

1. **Single Responsibility** - Each command should have one clear purpose
2. **Context Awareness** - Adapt behavior appropriately for different work types
3. **Clear Boundaries** - Well-defined entry/exit criteria and transitions
4. **Quality Focus** - Built-in validation and quality gates
5. **Comprehensive Checklists** - Cover all necessary activities for success

### Documentation Standards

1. **Complete User Guides** - Every command needs comprehensive user documentation
2. **Clear Examples** - Provide concrete examples for each context type
3. **Troubleshooting** - Include common issues and solutions
4. **Integration Guidance** - Show how commands fit into broader workflows

### Maintainability

1. **Consistent Structure** - Follow established patterns and templates
2. **Version Control** - Track changes and maintain backward compatibility
3. **Regular Review** - Update commands based on user feedback and lessons learned
4. **Cross-Reference Updates** - Keep all related documentation synchronized

### Security Considerations

1. **Tool Restrictions** - Only allow necessary tools in allowed-tools list
2. **Input Validation** - Validate all inputs and parameters
3. **Access Control** - Ensure commands only access appropriate resources
4. **Audit Trail** - Log command usage and outcomes for review

## Common Pitfalls

### Design Issues

**Over-Complex Commands**
- *Problem*: Trying to do too much in one command
- *Solution*: Break complex workflows into multiple focused commands

**Insufficient Context Adaptation**
- *Problem*: One-size-fits-all approach doesn't work for different contexts
- *Solution*: Design clear adaptations for business/ML/software contexts

**Weak Quality Gates**
- *Problem*: Commands allow progression without proper validation
- *Solution*: Implement comprehensive quality checks and exit criteria

### Implementation Issues

**Missing CLI Integration**
- *Problem*: Relying solely on LLM for critical business logic
- *Solution*: Implement deterministic CLI commands for validation and enforcement

**Incomplete Documentation**
- *Problem*: Commands without proper user guides
- *Solution*: Create comprehensive documentation following established patterns

**Poor Error Handling**
- *Problem*: Commands fail gracefully without clear guidance
- *Solution*: Anticipate failure modes and provide clear recovery paths

### Maintenance Issues

**Outdated References**
- *Problem*: Commands reference moved or changed files
- *Solution*: Regular validation and updates of file references

**Inconsistent Updates**
- *Problem*: Command updates without corresponding documentation updates
- *Solution*: Include documentation review in command change process

**Missing Integration Testing**
- *Problem*: Commands work in isolation but fail in workflows
- *Solution*: Test command integration and workflow transitions regularly
