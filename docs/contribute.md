# Contributing to the Value Train

## üé´ Welcome Aboard!

So you want to join the crew of the AgenticOps Value Train‚Ñ¢? Excellent! You're early, we're still building the train and laying the track. We're looking for dedicated engineers, conductors, and operators to help keep this train running smoothly and on schedule. Whether you're here to lay new track, improve our engines, or help passengers reach their destination, we've got a spot for you in our locomotive.

## üöÇ Getting Your Ticket Punched

Before you can start contributing, you'll need to get your development environment set up and understand our operating procedures. Think of this as your conductor training program!

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools in your engineer's toolkit:

- **Python 3.8+** - Our primary locomotive engine
- **Git with LFS support** - For managing our cargo (including heavy data files)
- **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** - Your communication system with dispatch
- **Make** - Our standard build automation system
- **Pre-commit** - Quality control checkpoints

### Setting Up Your Local Station

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   gh repo fork charleslbryant/agenticops-value-train --clone
   cd agenticops-value-train
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment:**
   ```bash
   make venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   make install
   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks (our quality control system):**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   pre-commit install --hook-type prepare-commit-msg
   ```

4. **Run the test suite to ensure everything's working:**
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   ```

5. **Take a quick tour of the codebase:**
   ```bash
   # Review the main documentation
   cat docs/product/agenticops-value-train.md
   
   # Understand our architecture
   cat docs/architecture/architecture.md
   
   # Check current session status
   cat docs/session-context/ACTIVE_SESSION.md
   ```

## üõ§Ô∏è Our Operating Procedures

### The Value Train Methodology

We follow a structured approach to development that mirrors our AI agent methodology:

#### Agent Roles
When contributing, you'll work within one of our specialized roles:
- **Conductor** - Orchestrates features and coordinates between contributors
- **Lab** - Handles data processing, testing, and experimentation
- **Studio** - Designs architecture and system interfaces  
- **Ops** - Manages infrastructure, deployment, and automation
- **Evaluator** - Validates quality and performance
- **Improver** - Optimizes existing features and workflows

#### Mode-Based Development
We use bounded working contexts called "modes" for focused development:
- `/design` - Architecture planning and system design
- `/build` - Feature implementation and testing
- `/evaluate` - Quality validation and performance testing
- `/deliver` - Final testing and release preparation

### Git Workflow

Our git workflow follows the Value Train principles:

1. **Branch Naming Convention:**
   ```
   <phase>/<feature-description>_<issue-id>
   ```
   Examples:
   - `build/add-makefile-automation_21`
   - `design/ticket-yml-schema_34`

2. **Commit Message Format:**
   ```
   <type>: <description>
   
   #complete phase:<issue-id>
   
   Co-Authored-By: <your-name> <your-email>
   ```

3. **Quality Gates:**
   - All commits must pass pre-commit hooks
   - All tests must pass in CI
   - Code coverage must be maintained
   - Documentation must be updated for user-facing changes
