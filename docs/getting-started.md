# Getting Started with Value Train

## What You Need
- A software project (any language, any size)
- 5 minutes to understand the concept

## The Concept
Value Train is just 9 modes that represent stages of building software:

1. **Intake** - Understand what to build
2. **Discover** - Learn what you don't know
3. **Scope** - Estimate the work
4. **Design** - Plan the solution
5. **Build** - Write the code
6. **Evaluate** - Test it works
7. **Deliver** - Ship to production
8. **Operate** - Keep it running
9. **Improve** - Make it better

## Your First Value Train

### Step 1: Pick a task
Something real you need to build. Start small.

### Step 2: Go through intake
Ask yourself:
- What problem am I solving?
- Who needs this?
- What does success look like?

Write down the answers.

### Step 3: Continue through modes
Move to `/discover` if you need to research, or `/design` if you already know the approach.

### Step 4: Build and ship
Once you understand what to build and how, code it, test it, and deploy it.

## Using with Claude.ai

Simply tell Claude:
```
Let's use Value Train for [your task]. Start with /intake
```

Claude will guide you through each mode with relevant questions.

## Using the C# CLI

```bash
cd src/ValueTrain
dotnet run
```

Follow the interactive prompts to track your progress through modes.

## Tips

- **Don't overthink** - The modes are just a checklist
- **Skip what doesn't apply** - Not every task needs every mode
- **Small iterations** - Go through quickly, then repeat if needed
- **Document decisions** - Future you will thank present you
