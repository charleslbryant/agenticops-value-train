## Product Context Summary

**AgenticOps Value Train™** is an AI-driven value delivery system that transforms chaotic ML project workflows into structured, automated, and auditable value streams. The platform orchestrates specialized AI agents (Conductor, Lab, Studio, Ops, Evaluator, Improver) through standardized phases with automated quality gates.

### Key Product Principles
- **Agent-First Design**: Specialized AI agents with clear responsibilities and automated coordination
- **Quality-Driven Automation**: Comprehensive validation at every automation point
- **Session-Based Context**: Persistent state management with complete audit trails
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Focus on process automation rather than infrastructure competition

### Current Development Focus
We are in **Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation**, implementing core Value Train infrastructure with automated quality gates and basic agent coordination per the [Value Train Alignment Plan](../value-train-alignment-plan.md).

## Usage by AI Assistants

AI assistants should reference these files to:
- Align all development decisions with product vision and strategy
- Prioritize features based on strategic roadmap phases
- Ensure technical implementations support long-term product goals
- Maintain consistency with agent-centric design principles
- Focus on workflow orchestration value proposition
