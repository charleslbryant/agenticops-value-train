# PRD-001: Interactive /plan Command with Feature Slice Requirements

## Executive Summary
The `/plan` command is an interactive planning assistant that transforms requirements gathering into end-to-end delivery slices. Rather than separating product requirements from implementation planning, it generates Feature Slice Requirements Documents (FSRDs) that combine user value with technical execution. This eliminates handoffs between product and engineering while forcing teams to think in deliverable vertical slices.

## Problem Statement
Traditional planning separates product requirements from implementation details, creating handoff friction and misaligned expectations. Teams often plan features horizontally (frontend, backend, database) rather than vertically (complete user journeys), leading to integration delays and partial value delivery. Current tools require context switching between product documentation and technical planning, reducing focus on the actual problem-solving.

## Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals
- Generate Feature Slice Requirements Documents that combine product and technical planning
- Force vertical slice thinking for end-to-end user value delivery
- Provide adaptive templates (Micro/Standard/Full) based on complexity
- Automatically create implementation plans with testable work items
- Eliminate handoffs between product requirements and technical execution
- Integrate seamlessly with Value Train workflow modes
- Reduce planning-to-delivery cycle time by 50%

### Non-Goals
- Replace human judgment in slice definition or technical decisions
- Manage project timelines or resource allocation across slices
- Handle cross-project dependencies or enterprise architecture
- Generate actual code implementations

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I want to type `/plan` and describe a feature so that I get a complete Feature Slice Requirements Document with implementation plan, not just product requirements.

**As a tech lead**, I want planning to force vertical slice thinking so that each deliverable provides end-to-end user value rather than partial technical layers.

**As a product owner**, I want requirements and implementation planning unified in a single document so that there's no product-engineering handoff friction.

**As a team**, I want adaptive templates (Micro/Standard/Full) so that simple features don't get over-documented while complex features get proper structure.

**As an AI agent user**, I want the planning conversation to generate testable work items and Definition of Done criteria automatically.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**MUST have** (P0)
- Interactive prompt asking "What would you like to plan?"
- Complexity detection to suggest appropriate FSRD template tier (Micro/Standard/Full)
- Generate Feature Slice Requirements Documents combining product and technical planning
- Create implementation plans with granular, testable work items (1-2 day granularity)
- Automatic Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD) checklists
- Real-time GitHub issue creation with FSRD content
- Force vertical slice thinking through conversation flow

**SHOULD have** (P1)
- Template tier escalation prompts ("This sounds complex. Expand to Standard template?")
- Work breakdown structure generation with acceptance criteria
- Session state persistence for multi-conversation planning
- Integration with Value Train mode progression (Plan → Research → Design → Build)
- Slice dependency detection and documentation
- Risk assessment with mitigation strategies

**COULD have** (P2)
- AI-generated success metrics and measurement plans
- Automatic linking to related slices/epics
- Template customization per project type
- Planning analytics and slice delivery metrics
- Integration with external project management tools

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: FSRD generation within 5 seconds, issue creation within 2 seconds
- **Usability**: Zero learning curve for Micro template, progressive disclosure for complexity
- **Reliability**: No data loss during planning sessions, template tier transitions
- **Integration**: Seamless GitHub API interaction, Value Train mode compatibility
- **Flexibility**: Adaptive complexity handling from simple tasks to multi-week slices
- **Quality**: Generated work items must be 1-2 day granularity and testable

## Technical Approach

The `/plan` command will be implemented as a Claude command that:
1. Detects complexity to suggest appropriate FSRD template tier (Micro/Standard/Full)
2. Maintains conversation state while gathering slice requirements
3. Generates Feature Slice Requirements Documents with implementation plans
4. Creates testable work items with 1-2 day granularity
5. Uses GitHub CLI (`gh`) for issue management with FSRD content
6. Integrates with Value Train mode progression

### Template Tier System
- **Micro FSRD**: Title, Description, Requirements, DoD (<1 day work)
- **Standard FSRD**: Core required sections (1-5 day slices)
- **Full FSRD**: All sections including risk assessment, metrics (>5 day or cross-team work)

### Complexity Detection Heuristics
- Multiple system components mentioned → Standard+
- Cross-team dependencies → Full
- New external integrations → Standard+
- Performance/security requirements → Standard+
- User research needed → Full

Key components:
- Command handler in `.claude/commands/plan.md`
- Three-tier FSRD template system
- Work breakdown structure generator
- Complexity detection engine
- GitHub API integration via `gh` CLI

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 80% of new features planned via `/plan` command with FSRD
- **Slice Quality**: 90% of generated work items are 1-2 day granularity and testable
- **Delivery Speed**: 50% reduction in planning-to-delivery cycle time
- **Handoff Elimination**: Zero product-engineering clarification meetings for FSRD-planned features
- **Vertical Thinking**: 100% of generated slices deliver end-to-end user value
- **Template Effectiveness**: <5% of features require template tier escalation during implementation

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Over-documentation for simple tasks | Medium | High | Make PRD generation optional |
| Lost context between sessions | High | Medium | Implement session state persistence |
| GitHub API rate limits | Low | Low | Batch operations, use gh CLI |
| Unclear requirements despite conversation | High | Low | Consultant mode for validation |

## Open Questions

- [ ] How sensitive should complexity detection be? (Conservative vs aggressive template escalation)
- [ ] Should work item breakdown be AI-generated or collaborative during conversation?
- [ ] How to handle slice dependencies in planning? (Reference existing slices vs create new ones)
- [ ] Should FSRD templates be customizable per project type or standardized?
- [ ] How to validate that generated work items are truly 1-2 day granularity?
- [ ] Integration approach with external project management tools (Jira, Linear, etc.)?

## Timeline

- **Planning**: 2024-01-15 (Complete)
- **Design**: 2024-01-16 to 2024-01-17
- **Implementation**: 2024-01-18 to 2024-01-22
