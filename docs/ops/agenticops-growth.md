# AgenticOps: Growth & Maturity Roadmap

## Goal

Provide a practical path for evolving from a small, high‑leverage ML delivery pod into a repeatable, enterprise‑grade AI engineering organization that can support multiple products, governed deployments, cost visibility, and continuous improvement at scale.

This roadmap answers: *When do we add people? Which skills first? What triggers automation vs hiring? How does maturity map to cost, schedule, and risk?* It draws on recognized MLOps maturity frameworks (Google, Microsoft), large‑scale ML systems lessons (Hidden Technical Debt, ML Test Score), team design patterns (Team Topologies), cloud cost forecasting for AI workloads (FinOps Foundation), and AWS enterprise MLOps persona playbooks.   
([*cloud.google.com*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), [*learn.microsoft.com*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model), [*papers.neurips.cc*](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf), [*teamtopologies.com*](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts), [*finops.org*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/), [*aws.amazon.com*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-an-end-to-end-mlops-pipeline-using-amazon-sagemaker-pipelines-github-and-github-actions/))

## Why a Maturity Roadmap

Small teams can ship pilot ML fast, but without a growth path they hit walls: brittle data feeds, hand‑deployed models, invisible costs, and audit gaps. Google’s MLOps guidance shows that going from “manual training + hand deploy” to “automated continuous training + governed promotion” requires additive capabilities across data validation, metadata, and CI/CD, these don’t appear organically. Microsoft’s MLOps maturity model similarly advocates incremental capability build‑out (vs big‑bang) to avoid overwhelming orgs. Hidden Technical Debt research warns that boundary erosion and undeclared dependencies compound cost over time if not managed. Bringing deliberate team structure (Team Topologies) and cost forecasting discipline (FinOps) early prevents runaway spend and burnout. AWS MLOps pipeline blueprints demonstrate how persona‑aligned automation reduces operational toil once multiple models and environments are in play. ([*cloud.google.com*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), [*learn.microsoft.com*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model), [*papers.neurips.cc*](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf), [*teamtopologies.com*](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts), [*finops.org*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/), [*aws.amazon.com*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-an-end-to-end-mlops-pipeline-using-amazon-sagemaker-pipelines-github-and-github-actions/))

## Capability Pillars

We track maturity across five interacting pillars. Each pillar advances somewhat independently, but scale requires all five above a minimum bar.

| Pillar                            | Description                                  | Early Focus                     | Scale Focus                                          | Key Risk if Neglected                   |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Data**                          | Ingest, quality, lineage, privacy            | Secure access; schema capture   | Automated validation; contracts; change mgmt         | Silent data drift → model failure.      |
| **Modeling**                      | Feature eng, training, experimentation       | Baselines; reproducible scripts | Automated training, HPO at scale, ensembles          | Unreproducible results; slow iteration. |
| **Platform / MLOps**              | CI/CD, environments, infra‑as‑code, registry | Scripted deploy, versioning     | Fully automated pipelines, multi‑env promotion       | Hand deploy errors; long lead times.    |
| **Governance & Risk**             | Model cards, audit, compliance, bias         | Minimal doc; manual review      | Automated eval packs; signed approvals; traceability | Regulatory exposure; rollback gaps.     |
| **Business Integration & FinOps** | KPI linkage, cost vis, ROI                   | Pilot KPIs, manual cost rollups | Dashboards, cost per prediction, chargeback          | Unbounded spend; unclear value.         |

Pillar framing aligns with Google’s continuous delivery architecture (data, pipeline, metadata), Microsoft’s maturity checklist (governance, DevOps integration), and FinOps guidance on connecting cloud spend to business outcomes.

## Maturity Levels (L0–L3)

We’ll use an adapted 4‑level ladder blending Google’s Level 0/1/2, Microsoft’s staged model, and common enterprise practice.

### Level 0 – *Notebook Ops*

-   **Characteristics:** Ad‑hoc data pulls; local notebooks; manual CSV handoffs; copy‑paste model deploys; little monitoring.
-   **Team Shape:** 1–3 polymaths (lead + data‑curious engineers).
-   **Risks:** Non‑reproducible models; no lineage; surprise cloud bills when scaled. Google identifies this as the pre‑automation state; Microsoft flags it as “initial” maturity; debt accumulates fastest here. ([*cloud.google.com*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), [*learn.microsoft.com*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model), [*papers.neurips.cc*](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf))

### Level 1 – *Scripted Repeatability*

-   **Characteristics:** Source‑controlled code; batch ingestion scripts; containerized training; documented but manual deployment steps; basic experiment tracking.
-   **Team Shape:** Core pod emerges (Lead, Data, Feature, Training, DevSecOps, Evaluation Engineers). *This is the shape of DiscoverTec’s AI engineering team.*
-   **Upgrade Moves:** Central repo; environment files; data snapshots; cost tagging pilot. Google’s level where ML pipeline pieces exist but still largely manual; Microsoft calls this “repeatable.” ([*cloud.google.com*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), [*learn.microsoft.com*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model))

### Level 2 – *Automated CI/CD & Registry*

-   **Characteristics:** Automated training pipelines; model and data validation steps; model registry gating staging/prod; infra‑as‑code; rollback; cost dashboards.
-   **Team Shape:** Full pod includes a part time Platform engineer to manage cross organization tools and services. Initially, this can be one of the existing engineers in a split‑role.
-   **Benefits:** Shorter cycle time; reproducibility; audit artifacts; controlled spend. Referenced in Google’s continuous training (CT) architecture and AWS’s end‑to‑end SageMaker MLOps pipeline patterns; Microsoft marks this as “managed” maturity.   
    ([*cloud.google.com*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), [*learn.microsoft.com*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model), [*aws.amazon.com*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-an-end-to-end-mlops-pipeline-using-amazon-sagemaker-pipelines-github-and-github-actions/))

### Level 3 – *Continuous Training, Monitoring & Governance at Scale*

-   **Characteristics:** Automated drift detection; scheduled + trigger‑based retrains; multi‑model rollouts; model cards & compliance packages auto‑generated; chargeback cost metrics; portfolio dashboards.
-   **Team Shape:** Pod‑of‑pods (Data Platform group, Modeling group, Platform/MLOps group, Model Risk); Lead becomes a Portfolio Lead coordinating across client lanes; SRE/On‑Call rotation. Google’s high maturity level (continuous delivery + automated validation); Microsoft’s advanced stage; FinOps calls for integrated forecasting and cost accountability at this scale. ([*cloud.google.com*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), [*learn.microsoft.com*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model), [*finops.org*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/))

## Growth Waves

We think of growing team in 4 growth waves; each \~3–9 months depending on funding & demand.

### Wave A (0 → 3 Months)

-   **Purpose:** Stand Up Core Pod & First Use Case
-   **People:** Level 1 Pod
-   **Milestones:** Secure data feeds; baseline model; manual but scripted deploy; basic KPI tracking; cost tags on cloud resources.
-   **Exit Criteria:** Validated business lift; reproducible training run; doc’d hand deploy. This wave corresponds to moving from L0 to L1 in both Google & Microsoft maturity ladders.   
    ([*cloud.google.com*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), [*learn.microsoft.com*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model))

### Wave B (3 → 9 Months)

-   **Purpose:** Industrialize & Automate
-   **People Moves:** Formalize Model Evaluator; designate 0.5–1.0 FTE **MLOps/Platform Engineer** (may be upskilled AI Eng).
-   **Platform:** CI/CD pipeline (data prep → train → eval → registry → deploy); infra‑as‑code; automated tests (ML Test Score items); start model cards.
-   **Cost Ops:** Baseline cost per prediction; start FinOps forecast vs actual.
-   **Exit Criteria:** Push‑button deploy to staging; model registry gating; automated data validation; monthly cost dashboard. Maps to Google’s Level 2 automation and Microsoft’s managed/defined stage; introduces guardrails to curb technical debt flagged in Sculley et al.

Microsoft maturity model calls out scaling across workspaces and governance; AWS MLOps pipeline blog shows persona separation (data, build, deploy); FinOps guidance stresses showback/chargeback at portfolio stage. ([*learn.microsoft.com*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model), [*aws.amazon.com*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-an-end-to-end-mlops-pipeline-using-amazon-sagemaker-pipelines-github-and-github-actions/), [*finops.org*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/))

### Wave D (18 → 30 Months)

-   **Purpose:** Enterprise Practice / CoE
-   **People Moves:** Dedicated Platform/MLOps team; Model Risk & Compliance function; Feature Store productization; FinOps analyst; Portfolio Product Lead.
-   **Platform:** Automated retrain triggers; champion/challenger live experiments; governed catalog of approved models; audit exports.
-   **Business:** Chargeback; SLA tiers; cross‑client benchmarking. This corresponds to top maturity tiers where continuous delivery & governance are institutionalized; Team Topologies advocates platform + enabling teams to accelerate stream‑aligned delivery; FinOps stresses full lifecycle forecasting & optimization.

### Notes on Using the Matrix

-   Treat each cell as a **learning objective + backlog item**—tie skill acquisition to real work. This accelerates capability maturity while delivering product value. The Google MLOps guide encourages incremental capability build; Microsoft’s maturity model explicitly warns against “big-bang” adoption.   
    ([*Google Cloud*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*Microsoft Learn*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
-   Integrate **cost awareness** (FinOps) alongside technical maturity; waiting until after scale creates spend shocks that erode ROI. FinOps AI cost forecasting guidance stresses early tagging & unit economics visibility.   
    ([*FinOps Foundation*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [*TechRadar*](https://www.techradar.com/pro/breaking-silos-unifying-devops-and-mlops-into-a-unified-software-supply-chain?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

## Budget Mix by Maturity

Approximate % of total ML program spend (labor + cloud + tooling) by stage; use for high‑level planning.

| Stage           | Labor % | Cloud % | Tooling/Platform % | Notes                                     |
|-----------------|---------|---------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Pilot (L0‑L1)   | 80      | 15      | 5                  | Mostly people; cloud tiny.                |
| Repeatable (L1) | 65      | 25      | 10                 | Start automating; infra rising.           |
| Automated (L2)  | 55      | 30      | 15                 | Platform invest; cost dashboards.         |
| Scale (L3)      | 45      | 35      | 20                 | Multi‑client infra amortized; FinOps key. |

These ratios reflect FinOps Foundation observations that AI cloud cost % increases with scale and must be forecast; Microsoft model suggests tooling investment grows w/ maturity; AWS enterprise MLOps posts note platform build cost upfront but lowers marginal project cost.   
([*finops.org*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/), [*learn.microsoft.com*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model), [*aws.amazon.com*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-an-end-to-end-mlops-pipeline-using-amazon-sagemaker-pipelines-github-and-github-actions/))

## Project Roadmaps

When estimating a new client project, map their current maturity (L0–L3) across each Pillar; the *delta* to your target delivery level drives effort. Microsoft’s maturity model explicitly recommends gap analysis to scope engagements; Google’s whitepaper encourages capability scoring to focus automation spend; AWS’s enterprise MLOps foundation roadmap ties persona uplift to platform tasks. Use these to structure SOW phases (foundation, pilot, scale).   
([*learn.microsoft.com*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model), [*cloud.google.com*](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning), [*aws.amazon.com*](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-an-end-to-end-mlops-pipeline-using-amazon-sagemaker-pipelines-github-and-github-actions/))

### Roadmap Heatmap Template

Create a spreadsheet where rows = Capability Pillars × Activities (Data Contracts, Auto Validation, Registry, Drift Monitoring, FinOps Dashboard, etc.) and columns = Quarters (Q1–Q8). Color code when each capability reaches: Pilot, Production, Scaled, Automated. Add a people lane with FTE counts by role.

Heatmap‑style capability roadmaps are a recommended artifact in Google’s practitioner MLOps guide and widely used in Microsoft architecture planning; FinOps uses similar phased cost capability charts.

### Example 24‑Month Growth Plan

-   **Q0 Kickoff:** Core pod hired; secure data; baseline model.
-   **Q1:** Data ingestion automated; repo + env; cost tagging.
-   **Q2:** CI/CD for training; model registry; manual review gate.
-   **Q3:** Serverless → autoscale endpoint; basic drift monitor.
-   **Q4:** Multi‑client ready data pipelines; FinOps dashboard live.
-   **Q5:** Automated retrain triggers; champion/challenger; on‑call.
-   **Q6:** Model cards auto‑generated; audit export; chargeback.
-   **Q7+:** Feature store roll‑out; cross‑client benchmarking; optimization.

Timelining automation in waves mirrors the stepwise capability build called out in Google’s practitioner guide, Microsoft’s maturity model, and AWS enterprise MLOps roadmap.

### Culture & Collaboration Enablers

Process & tooling won’t stick without habits:

-   **Weekly Ops + Cost Review** (pod + client), cost awareness = FinOps foundation. ([*finops.org*](https://www.finops.org/wg/how-to-forecast-ai-services-costs-in-cloud/))
-   **Model Review Board** gating promotions, recommended in Microsoft governance guidance. ([*learn.microsoft.com*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/ai-ml/guide/mlops-maturity-model))
-   **Blameless Postmortems on Data Incidents**, reduces debt; echoed in Sculley et al. technical debt discussion. ([*papers.neurips.cc*](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf))
-   **Stream‑Aligned Teams, Clear Interfaces**, Team Topologies pattern accelerates flow and reduces coordination drag. ([*teamtopologies.com*](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts))
-   **Unified DevOps+MLOps Supply Chain**, avoid silo failure mode highlighted in enterprise adoption reporting. ([*techradar.com*](https://www.techradar.com/pro/breaking-silos-unifying-devops-and-mlops-into-a-unified-software-supply-chain))

### Using This Roadmap with Your Business Case

1.  Identify current maturity level for each Pillar.
2.  Pick target maturity (likely L2 for production, path to L3 in year 2).
3.  Size effort gap and align to DiscoverTec engagement phases.
4.  Feed infra assumptions into the Azure/AWS Cost Model; feed labor FTE growth into the Business Case financial model.
5.  Track realized cost vs forecast monthly; adjust hiring wave triggers.

Gap‑driven planning is directly recommended in Microsoft’s maturity model and Google’s practitioner guide; AWS enterprise MLOps roadmap ties capability readiness to persona workloads, informing staffing.
