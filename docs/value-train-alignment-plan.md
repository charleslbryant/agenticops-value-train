# AgenticOps Value Train Alignment Plan

This document outlines the strategic migration to enterprise-ready C# + Semantic Kernel implementation while aligning with the Value Train™ methodology. The plan focuses on the actual GitHub issues created for implementation.

## Executive Summary

**Strategic Pivot:** The repository requires migration from Python to C# + Microsoft Semantic Kernel for enterprise deployment, as documented in ADRs 0007-0019. This migration unlocks enterprise-grade agent orchestration, Microsoft ecosystem integration, and production-ready scalability while maintaining all Value Train methodology principles.

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Foundation Ready (What We Have)
- Value Train methodology and phase definitions
- Core directory structure and mode checklists
- Comprehensive ADR documentation (19 architectural decisions)
- Session management framework concepts
- Asset registry and pipeline configuration
- Product documentation and vision

### 🔄 Migration Required (Language/Platform Shift)
- **Python → C# + Semantic Kernel** for enterprise agent orchestration
- **File-based → Distributed context management** for concurrent agent operation
- **Manual → Automated** phase transitions and handoffs
- **Prototype → Production-grade** infrastructure and monitoring

### 🎯 New Implementation Targets
- Enterprise-grade C# agent framework with Semantic Kernel
- .NET 8 build system and infrastructure
- MCP tool integration via .NET libraries
- Distributed session contexts with Azure integration
- Production-ready monitoring and observability
