# AI Use Case Canvas

## Business

### Opportunity

What problem are we solving? Why does it matter? Describe the inefficiency or risk and its business impact.

### Desired Outcome

Define success in measurable terms (e.g., reduce processing time by X%, improve accuracy to Y%). Include OKRs, KPIs, or success criteria.

## Scope

### Problem

Who is the user? What pain point does AI address?

### Vision

Describe the scenario: how AI will integrate into workflows, who will use it, and why it adds value.

### Constraints

What’s in scope and out of scope? Note constraints like data type, domain restrictions, and excluded regulatory domains.

## Data

### Source

List data types and origins (databases, APIs, logs), indicating structured vs unstructured data.

### Quality

Detail volumes, known issues (e.g., missing values), and how these will be corrected.

### Processing

Outline how data will be collected, cleaned, transformed, and integrated. Mention pipelines, tools, any anonymization.

## Approach

### Technique

Explain whether using classification, NLP, forecasting, etc. Justify the choice.

### Flow

Describe the AI logic. For example, "The model will predict churn from behavior data, outputting a risk score."

## Lifecycle

### Prototype

Small-scale test using limited data or simplified model. Include success metrics.

### Production

Architecture, APIs, batching vs real-time, scaling needs, reliability, logging.

### Improvement

Monitor key metrics (accuracy, drift, fairness). Define retraining triggers, versioning process, responsibilities.

## Governance

### Safety

Test model behavior under unusual inputs and plan for adversarial robustness and fallback mechanisms.

### Security

Protect data using encryption, access controls, and endpoint security. Conduct threat modeling and audits. Ensure compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### Ethics

Define protected groups and measure fairness using standard metrics. Apply mitigation strategies to reduce bias. Align model development with principles such as human oversight, autonomy, and harm prevention.

### Explainability

Ensure users and stakeholders understand how and why decisions are made. Provide explainability through user-facing summaries, model decision artifacts, and documentation. Maintain logs for review and auditing. Assign clear ownership for model outcomes, risk management, and regulatory compliance. Establish regular oversight and review schedules.

### Traceability

Track dataset sources, transformations, model versions, evaluation results, and key decisions. Maintain documentation to support auditing, reproducibility, and regulatory compliance.

## Collaboration

### Team

List roles: product owner, data scientist, engineer, domain expert, security/privacy lead.

### Responsibilities

Assign each person’s contributions.

### Communication

Define meetings, documentation updates, demos, and stakeholder communication.

## Roadmap

### Milestones

Prototype Internal review Pilot or beta Full deployment Post-launch review

### Dependencies

Needed data access, infrastructure, and stakeholder inputs. Call out legal or audit dependencies.

### Next Steps

Define immediate actions: data acquisition, environment setup, ethics kickoff, prototype version.
