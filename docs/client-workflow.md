# Client Project Workflow

How to use Value Train for client work, from initial meeting to delivery.

## Overview

Client work requires balancing business needs with technical realities. The Value Train helps structure this process:

- **Plan** - Understand client's business needs
- **Research** - Investigate their technical landscape
- **Scope** - Define the simplest solution that delivers value
- **Design** through **Deliver** - Build and ship
- **Operate** & **Improve** - Ongoing support

## Mode-by-Mode Client Workflow

### Plan Mode - Client Discovery

**Purpose:** Understand what the client really needs (not just what they ask for)

**Activities:**
```markdown
## Client Meeting Agenda
1. Current situation - What's the problem?
2. Desired outcome - What does success look like?
3. Stakeholders - Who will use this?
4. Timeline - When do they need it?
5. Budget - What resources are available?
6. Constraints - Technical, regulatory, organizational
```

**Key Questions:**
- What business problem are we solving?
- How are they doing it now?
- What's the impact of not solving this?
- Who are the end users?
- What's the ROI expectation?

**Deliverables:**
- Meeting notes
- Business requirements document
- Success criteria
- GitHub issues for each requirement

**Example:**
```markdown
## Issue #101: Dashboard for Sales Metrics

### Business Need
Sales managers need real-time visibility into team performance to make daily decisions.

### Current State
- Using Excel spreadsheets updated weekly
- No mobile access
- 3 hours/week manual data entry

### Desired State
- Real-time dashboard
- Mobile responsive
- Automated data sync from CRM

### Success Criteria
- Reduce reporting time by 80%
- Daily usage by all 5 sales managers
- Zero manual data entry
```

### Research Mode - Technical Discovery

**Purpose:** Understand client's technical environment and constraints

**Activities:**
```markdown
## Technical Assessment Checklist
- [ ] Current tech stack
- [ ] Integration points (APIs, databases)
- [ ] Authentication systems
- [ ] Security requirements
- [ ] Compliance needs
- [ ] Performance expectations
- [ ] Existing documentation
- [ ] Access to systems
```

**Investigation Areas:**
- What systems need to integrate?
- What data sources are available?
- What are the security constraints?
- What's their deployment process?
- Who maintains their systems?

**Document Findings:**
```markdown
## Technical Findings

### Environment
- AWS hosted
- PostgreSQL database
- REST API available
- OAuth 2.0 authentication

### Constraints

```

### Scope Mode - MVP Definition

**Purpose:** Find the simplest solution that delivers business value

**MVP Strategy:**
```markdown
## Scoping Decision Framework

```

### Design Mode - Technical Specification

**Purpose:** Create detailed specifications the client can review

**Client-Friendly Specs:**
```markdown
## Technical Specification

### User Flow
1. User logs in with corporate credentials
2. Dashboard loads with today's metrics
3. User can filter by date range
4. User can drill down into details

### Data Flow

### Build Mode - Implementation

**Client Communication During Build:**

**Daily Updates (if needed):**
```markdown
## Daily Status - Day 3

### Completed

## Common Client Scenarios

### Scenario: Scope Creep
**Client:** "Can we also add feature X?"

**Response:**
```
"Great idea! Let me assess the impact:
- Additional time: 3 days
- Affects: Testing timeline
- Options:
  1. Add to Phase 2
  2. Replace feature Y
  3. Extend timeline

What works best for your priorities?"
```

### Scenario: Urgent Bug
**Client:** "This is broken and we need it fixed NOW!"

**Response:**
```
"I understand the urgency. Let me investigate:
1. I'll diagnose within 1 hour
2. Provide fix timeline
3. Deploy emergency patch if critical

Can you describe what you're seeing?"
```

### Scenario: Vague Requirements
**Client:** "Make it more user-friendly"

**Response:**
```
"I want to ensure we improve the right things. Could you help me understand:
- Which parts feel difficult?
- What tasks take too long?
- What would 'user-friendly' look like to you?

Could we do a quick screen share?"
```

## Success Factors

### What Clients Value
1. **Reliability** - Do what you say
2. **Communication** - Keep them informed
3. **Business Understanding** - Speak their language
4. **Problem Solving** - Offer solutions, not problems
5. **Results** - Deliver business value

### Red Flags to Watch
- Unclear requirements
- No designated decision maker
- Constantly changing priorities
- Unrealistic timelines
- Poor communication
- No access to needed resources

## Summary

The Value Train for client work emphasizes:
1. **Understanding business needs** (Plan)
2. **Researching constraints** (Research)
3. **Finding simple solutions** (Scope)
4. **Clear communication** throughout
5. **Delivering value** incrementally
6. **Building relationships** for future work

Remember: Clients hire you to solve business problems, not write code. Keep the business value front and center in every mode.
