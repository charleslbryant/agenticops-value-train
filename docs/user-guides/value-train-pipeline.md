# Value Train Pipeline

The Value Train Pipeline is a comprehensive workflow for software development that emphasizes quality, collaboration, and continuous improvement. This pipeline consists of 10 distinct modes, each serving a specific purpose in the development lifecycle.

## Pipeline Overview

```
Plan → Research → Design → Build → Validate → Review → Deliver → Operate → Evaluate → Improve
```

## Mode Descriptions

### 1. Plan
**Purpose:** Define business requirements and objectives
- Identify stakeholder needs
- Document success criteria
- Define project scope and constraints
- Create initial requirements documentation
- Establish measurable goals

### 2. Research
**Purpose:** Investigate technical approaches and gather information
- Explore existing solutions
- Evaluate technology options
- Assess technical feasibility
- Research best practices
- Document findings and recommendations

### 3. Design
**Purpose:** Create comprehensive designs across multiple dimensions
- **UX Design:** User experience flows and wireframes
- **UI Design:** Visual design and component specifications
- **Technical Design:** Architecture and implementation specifications
- **Go-to-Market:** Strategy for introducing features to users
- Document design decisions and rationale

### 4. Build
**Purpose:** Implement the solution through code
- Write production code
- Follow coding standards and conventions
- Implement features incrementally
- Create necessary documentation
- Commit changes frequently

### 5. Validate
**Purpose:** Ensure quality through comprehensive testing
- Write and run unit tests
- Perform integration testing
- Execute end-to-end tests
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Fix identified issues

### 6. Review
**Purpose:** Collaborative evaluation and approval process
- Code review by peers
- Pull request review and feedback
- Client demonstrations
- Incorporate feedback
- Merge approved changes

### 7. Deliver
**Purpose:** Deploy the solution to production
- Prepare deployment artifacts
- Execute deployment process
- Verify deployment success
- Update release documentation
- Communicate release to stakeholders

### 8. Operate
**Purpose:** Monitor and maintain the running system
- Monitor system health
- Track performance metrics
- Respond to incidents
- Perform routine maintenance
- Ensure system stability

### 9. Evaluate
**Purpose:** Assess delivery against original requirements
- Compare outcomes to plan requirements
- Measure success criteria
- Gather user feedback
- Document lessons learned
- Identify gaps or issues

### 10. Improve
**Purpose:** Optimize and enhance the solution
- Implement optimizations
- Add enhancements based on feedback
- Refactor for maintainability
- Update documentation
- Plan future iterations

## Mode Transitions

### Natural Flow
While the pipeline presents a linear flow, real-world development often requires:
- **Iteration:** Returning to earlier modes based on findings
- **Parallelization:** Working on multiple modes simultaneously
- **Skipping:** Some modes may not apply to every task

### Common Patterns

#### Feature Development
```
Plan → Research → Design → Build → Validate → Review → Deliver
```

#### Bug Fix
```
Research → Build → Validate → Review → Deliver
```

#### Enhancement
```
Evaluate → Plan → Design → Build → Validate → Review → Deliver → Improve
```

## Working with Modes

### Documentation
Each mode transition should be documented in the GitHub issue:
- Current mode status
- Completed activities
- Key decisions made
- Next steps

### Example Issue Update
```markdown
## Current Mode: Validate
Previously completed: Plan, Research, Design, Build

### Completed in this mode:
- ✅ Unit tests written (15 tests, 100% coverage)
- ✅ Integration tests passing
- ⬜ E2E tests in progress
- ⬜ Performance testing pending

### Next: Review
Will prepare PR and schedule demo with client
```

## Best Practices

### Plan Mode
- Involve all stakeholders early
- Document assumptions explicitly
- Define clear success metrics

### Research Mode
- Time-box research activities
- Document all findings
- Consider multiple approaches

### Design Mode
- Design for the user first
- Consider all aspects (UX, UI, technical)
- Get feedback before building

### Build Mode
- Follow TDD when appropriate
- Commit frequently
- Keep changes focused

### Validate Mode
- Test at multiple levels
- Automate where possible
- Document test scenarios

### Review Mode
- Be thorough but constructive
- Demo to stakeholders
- Document feedback

### Deliver Mode
- Follow deployment procedures
- Verify in production
- Communicate changes

### Operate Mode
- Monitor proactively
- Document incidents
- Maintain runbooks

### Evaluate Mode
- Be objective about outcomes
- Gather quantitative data
- Include user feedback

### Improve Mode
- Prioritize improvements
- Measure impact
- Share learnings

## Integration with Tools

### GitHub Issues
- Use labels for current mode
- Update issue body with progress
- Link related PRs and commits

### Pull Requests
- Reference the mode in PR description
- Include validation results
- Document design decisions

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automate validation steps
- Gate deployments on reviews
- Monitor operational metrics

## Conclusion

The Value Train Pipeline provides a structured yet flexible approach to software development. By thinking in terms of modes, teams can:
- Maintain focus on current objectives
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all aspects
- Facilitate better collaboration
- Improve predictability and quality

Remember: The modes are mental models to organize work, not rigid rules. Adapt them to your specific context while maintaining the core principles of quality and continuous improvement.
