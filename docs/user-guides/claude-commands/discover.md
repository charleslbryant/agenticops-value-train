# /discover Command - User Guide

The `/discover` command switches Claude into Discover Mode, where it acts as the **Onboarder Agent** to conduct deep discovery of constraints, feasibility analysis, and comprehensive investigation of the problem space. This typically follows `/intake` in the Value Train workflow.

## When to Use /discover

Use `/discover` when you need to:
- **Validate initial requirements** - Test assumptions made during intake
- **Conduct feasibility analysis** - Determine if the proposed solution is viable
- **Investigate constraints** - Understand technical, business, and resource limitations
- **Analyze data availability** - Assess data sources, quality, and accessibility
- **Identify risks** - Conduct comprehensive risk analysis with mitigation strategies
- **Refine understanding** - Deepen knowledge of the problem space before scoping

## What /discover Does

The `/discover` command:
1. **Reviews intake artifacts** - Analyzes requirements documents from previous mode
2. **Validates assumptions** - Tests key assumptions through investigation and stakeholder input
3. **Assesses feasibility** - Evaluates technical, business, and resource constraints
4. **Investigates data** - Deep dive into data sources, quality, and availability
5. **Maps dependencies** - Identifies external dependencies and integration points
6. **Analyzes risks** - Comprehensive risk assessment with mitigation strategies
7. **Creates discovery report** - Documents all findings and recommendations

## How Context Detection Works

The `/discover` command adapts its investigation approach based on your work type:

### Business Context
**Focus**: Market validation, competitive analysis, regulatory requirements
- **Investigation Areas**: Market demand, competitive landscape, financial constraints
- **Key Questions**: Is there real market demand? What are regulatory requirements?
- **Validation Methods**: Market research, competitor analysis, stakeholder interviews
- **Output**: **Business Discovery Report** with market validation and feasibility
- **Risk Focus**: Market risks, competitive threats, regulatory compliance

### ML Engineering Context  
**Focus**: Data discovery, model feasibility, technical constraints
- **Investigation Areas**: Data quality, computational requirements, model complexity
- **Key Questions**: Is the data sufficient? Are performance targets realistic?
- **Validation Methods**: Data profiling, technical architecture review, prototype testing
- **Output**: **ML Discovery Report** with data assessment and technical feasibility
- **Risk Focus**: Data quality issues, computational limitations, model performance risks

### Software Engineering Context
**Focus**: Technical constraints, system integration, architecture analysis
- **Investigation Areas**: Existing systems, performance requirements, integration complexity
- **Key Questions**: How will this integrate? What are the performance implications?
- **Validation Methods**: System analysis, architecture review, technical spike testing
- **Output**: **Technical Discovery Report** with integration assessment
- **Risk Focus**: Integration complexity, performance bottlenecks, technical debt

## Using the /discover Command

### Basic Usage
```
/discover
```

Claude will switch to Discover Mode and begin comprehensive investigation of the problem space.

### Typical Entry Point
Usually follows `/intake`:
```
/intake    (gather requirements)
/clear
/discover  (validate and investigate)
```

### Command Response
When you run `/discover`, Claude will:

1. **Display Mode Header**: Shows Discover Mode - Onboarder Agent
2. **Show Current Status**: Reviews active work and session context
3. **Create Investigation Plan**: TodoWrite checklist with all discovery activities
4. **Begin Deep Investigation**: Starts systematic validation and analysis

### Sample Interaction

```
/discover

ðŸ¤– [Discover Mode - Onboarder Agent]

### 3. Constraint Discovery
Comprehensive analysis of limitations:
- **Technical Constraints**: Infrastructure, performance, integration
- **Business Constraints**: Budget, timeline, regulatory, organizational
- **Resource Constraints**: Team capacity, skills, tools, access
- **Data Constraints**: Quality, availability, privacy, compliance

### 4. Risk Analysis
Deep dive into potential challenges:
- **High-Impact Risks**: Issues that could derail the project
- **Likelihood Assessment**: Probability of risks occurring
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Approaches to reduce or eliminate risks
- **Contingency Plans**: Alternative approaches if risks materialize

### 5. Discovery Documentation
Comprehensive reporting of findings:
- **Executive Summary**: Key findings and recommendations
- **Detailed Analysis**: Evidence-based conclusions for each area

## Tips for Effective Discovery

### Preparation
- **Review intake thoroughly** - Understand what was learned and assumed
- **Plan investigation systematically** - Don't miss important areas
- **Engage stakeholders early** - Get access to key people and information
- **Gather evidence** - Focus on facts over opinions

### During Discovery
- **Stay objective** - Don't let preferences bias investigation
- **Dig deep** - Surface-level analysis isn't enough
- **Document everything** - Keep detailed records of findings
- **Validate with stakeholders** - Confirm critical findings

### Best Practices
- **Test assumptions rigorously** - Challenge what was assumed in intake
- **Look for showstoppers** - Identify issues that could kill the project
- **Understand constraints fully** - Know what you're working within
- **Plan for contingencies** - Have backup approaches ready

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Insufficient Access to Information**
- *Issue*: Can't get access to needed data or stakeholders
- *Solution*: Document access requirements and escalate to project sponsor

**Contradictory Information**
- *Issue*: Different sources provide conflicting information
- *Solution*: Investigate discrepancies and identify authoritative sources

**Overwhelming Complexity**
- *Issue*: Problem space seems too complex to understand fully
- *Solution*: Break down into smaller investigation areas and prioritize

**Stakeholder Availability**
- *Issue*: Key stakeholders not available for validation
- *Solution*: Document assumptions and schedule follow-up validation

### Getting Help

**Use Validation Commands**
```bash
# Validate discovery completeness
agenticops artifacts check --phase discover --strict

# Check discovery report quality
agenticops quality check --artifact discovery-report.md --template discovery

# Validate stakeholder sign-off
agenticops stakeholders validate --phase discover
```

**Escalation Guidelines**
- Document what you cannot validate or investigate
- Clearly identify risks and assumptions
- Provide recommendations for addressing gaps
- Escalate blockers to appropriate decision makers

## Examples

### Business Context Example
**Input**: Market expansion opportunity
**Discovery Focus**: Market research, competitive analysis, regulatory requirements
**Output**: Business Discovery Report with market validation and go/no-go recommendation

### ML Context Example
