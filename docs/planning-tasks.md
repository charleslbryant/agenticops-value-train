# Planning Tasks and Ideas

This document captures tasks, ideas, and changes to review during `/plan` mode sessions. These items should be converted to GitHub issues when ready for implementation.

## Pending Tasks to Create Issues For

### 1. Implement Dependency Tracking for Parallel Task Execution
**Description**: We have dependency tracking in some of the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` files but need comprehensive tracking of dependencies in our rules and documentation. Agents need to understand dependencies to determine which tasks can run in parallel.

**Requirements**:
- Review existing dependency tracking in issue templates
- Create a dependency graph or matrix for all task types
- Document which tasks can run in parallel vs sequential
- Update task management rules to include dependency information
- Consider creating a dependency visualization tool

**Priority**: High - Critical for efficient agent coordination

### 2. Update All File Paths to Use Claude @includes Format
**Description**: Update all paths to files in this repo to use Claude @includes and @ paths to improve context utilization. This should be added as a rule in `/docs/rules/documentation-rules.md`.

**Requirements**:
- Audit all documentation for file path references
- Convert paths to @includes format (e.g., `@/docs/rules/task-management.md`)
- Update documentation-rules.md with the new standard
- Create a migration script to help update existing paths
- Update all templates to use the new format

**Priority**: Medium - Improves Claude's context efficiency

---

### 3. Integrate and Align Command Structures
**Description**: Better integrate the commands in `.claude/commands` with the commands defined in `docs/agenticops-value-train.md`. Merge the best of both worlds and align with `docs/templates/mode-header.md`.

**Requirements**:
- Review all commands in `.claude/commands` directory
- Compare with mode definitions in agenticops-value-train.md
- Extract checklists from command files to `/docs/rules/checklists`
- Update command files to reference the extracted checklist files
- Ensure alignment with mode-header.md template
- Create unified command structure documentation

**Priority**: Medium - Improves command consistency and maintainability

---

## Notes and Observations

- Consider creating a "Task Dependencies" section in each checklist file
- The @includes format will significantly reduce token usage when referencing files
- Command integration will help maintain single source of truth for workflows

## Future Considerations

- Automated dependency validation in CI/CD
- Command validation against mode definitions
- Context optimization metrics tracking
